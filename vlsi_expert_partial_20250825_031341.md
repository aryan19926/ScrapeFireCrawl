### [Unix For VLSI Industry - Part 3b - Assignment 2 - SHELL Scripting](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2022/01/shell-debugging-assignment-2.html)

## SHELL Scripting Debugging Assignment - 2

In the [previous assignment](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2022/01/shell-debugging-assignment-1.html), I have captured few of the practice question related to debugging part. We know very well how much this is important from Industry point of view. Like I said in last article - Understanding the Scripting syntax and using them in automation - these are 2 different things. Debugging the existing code OR say enhancing that as per the requirement is completely different. For that first you need to understand the different error messages and then you should know how to fix that part.

In this part also - there are list of questions which can help you to do practice.

1. Correct the below shell script to split the given string.

#! /bin/bash

string="abc,xyz,jkl,raw"

IFS=' '

read -r arr <<< "$string"

for val in "${arr\[@\]}";

do

printf "name = $val\\n"

done

2. Correct the below shell script to match the two input strings.

read a

read b

if \["$a"=!"$b"\] then

¬†¬†¬†¬†echo "Matched"

elif

¬†¬†¬†¬†echo "Not Matching"

fi

3. Correct the below shell script to create a shell function library.

function square(){

¬†¬†¬†¬†v1=$10

¬†¬†¬†¬†$n = $((v1\*v1))

¬†¬†¬†¬†echo $n

}

4. Correct the below shell script to create a shell function library to calculate the factorial of a given number.

function factorial(){

¬†¬†¬†¬†v1=$2

¬†¬†¬†¬†n=1

¬†¬†¬†¬†while \[\[ $v1 -gt 0 \]\];

do

v1=$(($v1 - 1))

done

¬†¬†¬†¬†echo $n

}

5. Correct the below shell script to calculate the number of users.

read userInput

case \[$userInput\] \[in\]

¬†¬†¬†¬†{1} lslogins -o USER ;

¬†¬†¬†¬†{2} who --count \

### [Unix For VLSI Industry - Part 4a- TASK 1 - SHELL Scripting](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2022/01/shell-scripting-task-1.html)

## SHELL Scripting Task - 1

In the previous articles or say [Assignment 1](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2022/01/shell-debugging-assignment-1.html) and [Assignment 2](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2022/01/shell-debugging-assignment-2.html), I have captured few of the practice question related to debugging of SHELL Scripting. We know very well how much this is important from Industry point of view. By now you are very much expert in the UNIX Command and specially writing any Kind of Script using the SHELL Scripting. I am now going to give you few small-small TASK which you can do yourself and these can be used directly in Industry with small modification as per the requirement.

This is the based on script or say automation, we normally use during regression-runs. If you don't know what's regressions - basically engineers run a set of code/tool on large set of small designs (known as Test cases) and analysis the result with respect to each test cases. Few test case are designed to be failed and few suppose to a pass (means should give expected result). If after running the code - result is different from the expected one - We consider regression testcase fail. :)

As you can see that it's looks like Interesting first time but it's huge in numbers and that's the reason there is a lot of automation happen around this using different type of scripting language. Today, we will discuss about the same but in SHELL scripting.

**Task 1a -:** There is a directory named ‚Äú **regression**‚Äù inside which there are more than a thousand sub-directories. Each sub-directory has two more sub-directories which are ‚Äú **golden\_dir**‚Äù and ‚Äú **current\_dir**‚Äù. Inside these sub-directories, a file with different versions is present.

- Write a script to diff files present in ‚Äú **golden\_dir**‚Äù and ‚Äú **current\_dir**‚Äù. If diff is valid then update the ‚Äú **golden\_dir**‚Äù sub-directory with the new version of the file.

**Task 1b -:**

- Step 1: Write a script named ‚Äú **parent.sh**‚Äù which run another script with ‚Äú\*.sh‚Äù extension only.
- If the user has a directory including 100 script files with different extensions in it. Write a script ‚Äúextension\_converter.sh‚Äù which can convert any extension of file to ‚Äú\*.sh‚Äù extension and call this script inside ‚Äúparent.sh‚Äù script.

**Task 1c :-**

- There is a directory containing more than 100 script files written in python, perl, and TCL syntax.
- Each python script has first line i.e., /usr/bin/python
- Each Perl script has first line i.e., /usr/bin/perl
- Each tcl script has first line i.e., /usr/bin/tclsh

Write a script to dump python scripts to ‚Äúpython‚Äù directory, perl scripts to ‚Äúperl‚Äù directory, and TCL scripts to ‚ÄúTCL‚Äù directory.

**Task 1d :** A directory contains thousands of files created in 2020 and 2021.

- Write a script to create a log file which contains the list of all files created in June 2020 along with the modified time.

Try these task and I am sure if you have prepared them today - Tomorrow you can use these in Industry with slight modification.

Stay Tune and Happy Learning.

I think for one to build basic concepts. Reading those books is not effective. I tried to read those kind of books once and it costs me a lot of time plus very confusing. In my opinion, we should use those books to reference but not for reading, especially reading the whole thing.

 There are lot of reasons but for you ...

 1) these are very close to outside Power Pins.

 2) Metal Width and Thickness are large - So less resistive in nature. So less Voltage Drop , if we will use these For Power and Ground.

 sir,

 What is the meaning of 16 in 16 ffc technology? Is the following explanation correct?

 In advanced CMOS technologies, e.g. 32nm, 28 nm, these numbers usually refer to 1/2 the contacted pitch of the DRAM ,(as they are the most compact circuit which can be fabricated out) which is also 1/2 the pitch of the first level of metalization (the closest to the silicon substrate). It is close to the printed gate length of transistors, but not identical(due to overlapping of gate with source and drain region, which further leads to parasitic overlap capacitance).

### [Semiconductor Physics: Electron Spinning in an ATOM](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2024/03/semiconductor-physics-electron-spining.html)

## Electron Spinning in an ATOM

We have discussed in our previous article ( [Semiconductor Physics:- Electron Configuration In ](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2024/03/semiconductor-physics-electron-configuration.html), about the atoms (and analogy) and the basic idea of electron movement. If you remember, we have finished our article just introducing the spining of electrons in 3D dimensions and about the quantum numbers

- **n****\-****principal quantum number**‚Äì This is same number as we know orbital no.

- **l****\- azimuthal quantum number** ‚Äì This is same as we knows,p,d,f

- **m****\-** **magnetic quantum number**.

"Among the three quantum numbers, there is another quantization condition called spin ( _s_) that electrons should fulfill. Every electron has its angular momentum or spin and can be expressed as..."

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjKzP-Y-bEeIbo4TLs_fswL6Qyprm_l-t2-xvkpB1iwSTlJu9XMXeXv3B0ZDJ0uorR7xYvxA1rxrKZOaXFqi8PtBeaOG-TcxWHnpJi5t5CWOGfjJhZxfE38636jAxmo6bbh5LSXoHz3Boe_-ehGKsmsfIkwwfCBQmYKUzu9OYHN1QVuysM1Xk2mTEVs8TY=s16000)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjKzP-Y-bEeIbo4TLs_fswL6Qyprm_l-t2-xvkpB1iwSTlJu9XMXeXv3B0ZDJ0uorR7xYvxA1rxrKZOaXFqi8PtBeaOG-TcxWHnpJi5t5CWOGfjJhZxfE38636jAxmo6bbh5LSXoHz3Boe_-ehGKsmsfIkwwfCBQmYKUzu9OYHN1QVuysM1Xk2mTEVs8TY)

Before going through the periodic table, there is the Pauli exclusion principle which stated that no two electrons have the same quantum numbers (_n_, _l_, _m_, and_s_). In other words, two electrons may have the same quantum number n, l, and m states but the spin states must be +1/2 and -1/2.

The configuration of electrons in different energy states is summarized in Table 1.

**Table** **1** The allowed energy states and the occupation of maximum number of electrons according to quantum rules.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYgeEOiAj5OBAaeLes832fToR4wLesnDMSh2Y08M_Q2sSjeNKQQHIle7gYxmPbthwdVjTxQrw7daFuqCaln0OE2tct2RZlrYu9RGbhqctnv4OrEC2DnLlH7oDdh3NafGhSoXkFJaEme8WzluOC9-y4daKj02DhucfKlynjRqKvyDMvq7Iqi7TlUJTIdRE/s16000/table.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYgeEOiAj5OBAaeLes832fToR4wLesnDMSh2Y08M_Q2sSjeNKQQHIle7gYxmPbthwdVjTxQrw7daFuqCaln0OE2tct2RZlrYu9RGbhqctnv4OrEC2DnLlH7oDdh3NafGhSoXkFJaEme8WzluOC9-y4daKj02DhucfKlynjRqKvyDMvq7Iqi7TlUJTIdRE/s849/table.PNG)

As an example, for the 3rd electronic orbit (n=3), l should be 0, 1, and 2 followed by equation 14. Similarly, m should be -l to +l including zero for each l value. Electrons can occupy each m value with a spin +/-1/2.

The different notations for different l values are used to express the electronic configuration

**_l_ = 0,1,2,3,4,5 .......**

_**l = s, p, d, f, g, h, .....**_

The electron state can be represented as

I think now you are able to understand whole electron configuration which you have studied in your college days. Let‚Äôs talk about few more examples, so that you can be familiar with Semiconductor and Physics very well.

For example, Si (ic No=14) and Ge (ic No= 32), the electronic configuration is

### [Semiconductor Physics:- Electrons configuration in ](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2024/03/semiconductor-physics-electron-configuration.html)

# **Electrons configuration in as per Quantum Mechanics**

To understand the movement of electrons in a semiconductor device, we need to understand the electronic configuration of an atom and how it interacts with the crystal lattice. We already know that atom consists of Neutrons (neutral charge) and Protons (positive charge) inside a nucleus &¬† Electrons (negative charge) revolved around the nucleus (Figure 1).

**Figure** **1** ic structure

**Note**: (Just for your information) If you remember in the intermediate level or BTech 1st year, we have studied in quantum mechanics that these electrons are restricted to certain energy levels (quantized). In this regard, Plank‚Äôs blackbody radiation and Einstein‚Äôs photoelectric effect established the discrete nature of light (quantization). In the late 1920s, quantum mechanics had developed in which Heisenberg developed matrix mechanics and Schr√∂dinger developed wave mechanics at the same time. Although the mathematical formulations are quite different, the basic principles are identical.

Although The Schr√∂dinger equation describes the interaction between particles(e.g. electrons) and potential field, it‚Äôs enormously difficult to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation in the case of complicated atoms (ic number greater than 1 or you can say the total no. of electrons in a neutral atom). Therefore, the solution of the hydrogen atom (atomic number 1) is significant to understand the permissible energy states for electron arrangements.

It is well known that a hydrogen atom consists of a single electron and a proton system. We can call this system a two-particle system. In some circumstances, the two-particle system's motion can be described as the motion of a single particle with respect to a **center of mass**. The mass of the particle is referred to as a reduced mass with respect to the center of the mass system. In this consideration, we‚Äôll assume that the electron is relatively moved around the proton, and the proton is located at the center (in this case at the origin). **Since protons have higher mass with respect to the electron, therefore we will consider the reduced mass is equal to the electron mass, and the proton is located at the origin.**

**Figure** **2** (a) Center of mass concept. (b) Position of an electron with respect to proton (Origin)

Note: - I know you may be thinking what is this. Why are we assuming so many things and nothing is fixed? Basially, in an atom when we say that Proton is in center, then its important to understand which center are we talking about!

_Let me explain you in my ( **Puneet's way**) and you try to visualise it. (People or scientist may not like it but at least you can understand it. From analogy point of view you can consider it's a cloud system. When we see a cloud can we say that it's a 1 cloud of this size, this is the boundry and this is center of cloud. but still we see that whole piece of cloud moving together and merging with other piece of cloud and they have center also and outer periphery also. So this ATOM structure is like that. Now, Try to understand._

- _A Cloud system having more denser at the center (which is also moving) or say that become center of whole cloud ( **center of the mass system**)._
- _This cloud portion which is present in the center we are saying it's Proton._
- _Rest of the portion of cloud, you can say it's electron. (remember this I am trying to explain you for Hydrogen atom)_
- _Now, you can say that if these are 2 things, can we separate out but that's not going to happen or I say if it will separate out then whole system collapse, so I (scientist) said that both are related to each other (one as positive and other as negative). if you seperate out these 2, whole cloud system collapse. So, when these 2 are together then we say it's an ATOM._
- _But still outer part of Cloud can be separate out from Center part and someother part can come and replace it. So, with respect to center part, outer part (electron) is tied with center part (proton)._

_Now, Read once again the above one and then below one. You will get more clearity._

The electrons and nucleus (especially protons) are interacted with by the Coulombic potential

**Figure** **3** Spherical polar co-ordinate system

Let‚Äôs try to understand a few key points/equations of Quantum mechanics. If you are interested, you can go into detail by referring to the standard textbooks. Here we are just capturing for reference purposes.

**Note**:\- If you want to skip, go to equation no 11 directly but I will recommend to read it once.

Assume that the potential distribution is spherically symmetric, a time-independent three-dimensional Schr√∂dinger equation in spherical coordinates can be written as

Note:- Hold ON - If you are thinking about so many equations - It's okay. All these are important (may be not today but it will be one day). I will explain you. Just read it once.

The negative expression specifies that the electrons are bound with the nucleus and the energy is quantized. It should be noted that the value of n should not be zero as the energy expression become invalid. Therefore, n should be an integer.

**Note:- Puneet's Way: -**

When Scientist studied it further they come to know the cloud is not in 2D and presence of outer area of cloud has some pattern in 3D (Dimensional). Also they figured out that outer surface have some motion and usually this motion is around the inner surface (neculus system - dense part) and this moment is not in X, Y, Z direction only but it's in angular form also. Remember - Whole Cloud system is moving but we are talking about the relative motion of outer cloud with respect to inner cloud (mass). and that's the reason of "Spherical polar co-ordinate system" come into the picture to correctly captured this whole system.

Among the three quantum numbers, there is another quantization condition called spin ( _s_) that electrons should fulfill. Every electron has its angular momentum or spin and can be expressed as

So, you might be thinking why all this??

I will say, have patience and we will explain all this to you in coming articles. This is an intro article. This will help you to understand the moment of electrons in the other orbits (also in outer most orbit, which is very important to understand as we always talk about Valency electron and Valence Band).

### [STA Tool Command - report\_timing -max\_paths\_count (OpenSTA -group\_count) : Part 1](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2019/11/sta-group-count-command-1.html)

As, I have shared last time that in this series of articles, we are going to discuss about the different command of STA Tools along with the concepts. We have used OpenSTA which is an open source tool and can be downloaded from [OpenSTA](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenSTA). It‚Äôs commands are similar to Primetime (Industry standard tool). By using OpenSTA you can understand the working of tool properly. Here, I have made some of the comparison between the commands of Primetime & OpenSTA (which I am going to use in another few articles). The command which I have selected is report\_timing (in Primetime) & report\_checks (in OpenSTA). The report\_checks / report\_timing command reports paths in the design

Employees are our most important customers because they can provide crucial insights into the overall customer experience. But they are often overlooked or neglected, and most companies do not view them as valuable assets either in terms of providing insights into the customer experience, or as brand ambassadors.

### [TCL Practice Task 3 (Scripting Language)](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/11/tcl-practice-task-3.html)

TCL is very important from automation point of view in VLSI Industry but somehow students are not ready to learn this. They think it's a programing (like software programing) and they are in VLSI Industry to do some hardware related job. Reason of this - they don't know the application of TCL in VLSI Industry. In these series of articles, I am listing down few of the small projects or say programs or say exercise which can help anyone to understand the use-model of TCL inside the Industry. As a fresher, it's worth trying these task/programs/exercise, it will boost your confidence.

This is third part. If you have missed first and second part, please visit it. [TCL Practice Task 1](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/11/tcl-practice-task-1.html) and [TCL Practice Task 2](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/11/tcl-practice-task-2.html).

To understand this Task, you should have Task 1 and Task 2 program handy. :)

After the first 2 task, Now it's time to add some features in those programs/tasks. :)

**Task 3:- User Input and Runtime decision**

**Step 1:** Create 1 Input file ("file\_input1.txt")

Content of "file\_input1.txt" is same as in the first 2 Tasks. So, you can copy this file from previous programs. Snapshot of the file is present below.

**Input File:** ‚Äúfile\_input1.txt‚Äù

¬†¬†¬† Name ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Delay ¬†¬† Trans ¬†¬† Load

¬†¬†¬† ---------------------------------------------

¬†¬†¬† AND1\_2X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 1.50ns ¬†¬† 0.1 ¬†¬† 1.25ff

¬†¬†¬† AND1\_3X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 1.75ns ¬†¬† 0.2 ¬†¬† 1.98ff

¬†¬†¬† AND2\_3X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 2.37ns ¬†¬† 0.3 ¬†¬† 2.27ff

¬†¬†¬† AND2\_4X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 1.82ns ¬†¬† 0.5 ¬†¬† 2.54ff

¬†¬†¬† NAND1\_2X ¬†¬† 2.14ns ¬†¬† 0.2 ¬†¬† 1.69ff

¬†¬†¬† NAND2\_3X ¬†¬† 2.48ns ¬†¬† 0.3 ¬†¬† 2.11ff

**Step 2:** Write a TCL program, where you will read input files "file\_input1.txt" and then you will display the name of these cells to the user as an info and ask them to choose cell name (or cells name) from the displayed list (which you have provided). According to the user input or inputs, you have to extract below information from input file ("file\_input1.txt") and display it in the below format (This is same output format as per Task 2 output).

Example 1:- If user Enter Cell name AND1\_2X then display data should be

¬†¬†¬† Name ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trans ¬†¬† Load ¬†¬† Delay ¬†¬† Total\_Delay

¬†¬†¬† ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

¬†¬†¬† AND1\_2X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 0.1 ¬†¬† 1.25ff ¬†¬† 1.50ns ¬†¬†¬†¬† 1.50ns

Example 2:- If user Enter Cell name AND1\_2X, AND2\_3X, AND2\_4X & NAND2\_3X then display data should be

¬†¬†¬† Name ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trans ¬†¬† Load ¬†¬† Delay ¬†¬† Total\_Delay

¬†¬†¬† ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

¬†¬†¬† AND1\_2X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 0.1 ¬†¬† 1.25ff ¬†¬† 1.50ns ¬†¬†¬†¬† 1.50ns

¬†¬†¬† AND2\_3X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 0.3 ¬†¬† 2.27ff ¬†¬† 2.37ns ¬†¬†¬†¬† 3.87ns

¬†¬†¬† AND2\_4X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 0.5 ¬†¬† 2.54ff ¬†¬† 1.82ns ¬†¬†¬†¬† 5.69ns

¬†¬†¬† NAND2\_3X ¬†¬† 0.3 ¬†¬† 2.11ff ¬†¬† 2.48ns ¬†¬†¬†¬† 8.17ns

**Note:**

- About Total Delay, We have already discussed in previous task ( [TCL Practice Task 2](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/11/tcl-practice-task-2.html))
- How are you going to ask data from user, you have freedom.
- User should be able to enter 1 (One) or multiple CELL name.
- If user enter wrong name, you should be able to provide them proper information / warning (that Cell name is incorrect).
- In case of wrong input, give user 2 more chances before exiting the program.
- After every wrong input, provide a option to user to quit (if they want).

**Step 3:** Print the above formated data as per user input onto the terminal & in output file "file\_output2.txt"

**Hint:**

- You have to reuse TCL program of Task 1 and Task 2.

 - Reading of File "file\_input1.txt" should be with the help of previous program only.
 - Get the user input and create a new file (temporary file) as per second input file (file\_input2.txt) format of Task 2.
 - Once you create a temp file, you can reuse the program of Task 2 as it is (just by converting that into procedure)

**Learning after this Program:**

- How to Open & Close Input files
- How to Read or Write from/in a file
- How to take inputs from the users.
- How to display info, warning and Error messages to user.
- Looping in a program and resetting a particular variable.
- Exit option.
- How to save user inputs in a variable or list of variables, even you don't know the number of inputs.
- How to save data in List and do different operations on that
- How to do Matching or say comparison of Data
- How to select only a specific data
- How to do mathematical calculations
- Different commands use-model

 - list, lindex, lappend
 - Foreach loop, While loop, If-else loop
 - gets and puts
 - split
 - expr
 - incr

- How to manage single space, multiple space
- Regular expression concepts
- Procedure concepts (proc in tcl)

 - How to write a Procedure
 - How to pass a value to Procedure
 - How to call a Procedure
 - How to get return from a Procedure (return command)

**Industrial Use of this Task:**

During the automation of data, many times either we work on input Template file (where user need to provide inputs by filling that) or ask inputs from user directly during runtime. These inputs can be in the form of YES/NO or may be some small inputs like Cell name or Path name.

I am sure this article will help you. In the Next article, we will discuss about a task where you have to take inputs from user as a command line option (even before running a program and not as Template file).

### [TCL Practice Task 2 (Scripting Language)](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/11/tcl-practice-task-2.html)

TCL is very important from automation point of view in VLSI Industry but students are lacking bigtime. Even if they learn, they face problem to understand the uses of TCL in VLSI Industry. In these series of articles, I am listing down few of the small projects or say programs or say exercise which can help anyone to understand the use-model of TCL in Industry. As a fresher, if you try at least once, it will boost your confidence. If you are able to automate below few task, more then 50% of work (based on TCL) can be done easily.

This is second part. If you have missed first part, please visit it ( [TCL Practice Task 1](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/11/tcl-practice-task-1.html)). Because to understand this Task, you should have Task 1 program handy. :)

If you have completed previous task (task 1), I am sure now you are good in file handling.

**Task 2:- Mapping Two Files**

Step 1: Create 2 Input files ("file\_input1.txt" and "file\_input2.txt")

Content of "file\_input1.txt" is same as in the previous Task. So, you can copy file from last program. Snapshot of both the files are present below.

**Input File:** ‚Äúfile\_input1.txt‚Äù

¬†¬†¬† Name ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Delay ¬†¬† Trans ¬†¬† Load

¬†¬†¬† ---------------------------------------------

¬†¬†¬† AND1\_2X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 1.50ns ¬†¬† 0.1 ¬†¬† 1.25ff

¬†¬†¬† AND1\_3X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 1.75ns ¬†¬† 0.2 ¬†¬† 1.98ff

¬†¬†¬† AND2\_3X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 2.37ns ¬†¬† 0.3 ¬†¬† 2.27ff

¬†¬†¬† AND2\_4X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 1.82ns ¬†¬† 0.5 ¬†¬† 2.54ff

¬†¬†¬† NAND1\_2X ¬†¬† 2.14ns ¬†¬† 0.2 ¬†¬† 1.69ff

¬†¬†¬† NAND2\_3X ¬†¬† 2.48ns ¬†¬† 0.3 ¬†¬† 2.11ff

**Input File:** ‚Äúfile\_input2.txt‚Äù

¬†¬†¬† CELL\_1: ¬†¬† AND1\_2X

¬†¬†¬† CELL\_2: ¬†¬† AND2\_3X

¬†¬†¬† CELL\_3: ¬†¬† AND2\_4X

¬†¬†¬† CELL\_4: ¬†¬† NAND2\_3X

Step 2: Reuse TCL Program of Task 1 and convert into procedure or procedures.

Step 3: Write a TCL program, where you will read both input files "file\_input1.txt" & "file\_input2.txt" and as per the CELL name present in second file (e.g. AND1\_2X ...), you have to extract below data and display it in the below format.

¬†¬†¬† Name ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trans ¬†¬† Load ¬†¬† Delay ¬†¬† Total\_Delay

¬†¬†¬† ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

¬†¬†¬† AND1\_2X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 0.1 ¬†¬† 1.25ff ¬†¬† 1.50ns ¬†¬†¬†¬† 1.50ns

¬†¬†¬† AND2\_3X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 0.3 ¬†¬† 2.27ff ¬†¬† 2.37ns ¬†¬†¬†¬† 3.87ns

¬†¬†¬† AND2\_4X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 0.5 ¬†¬† 2.54ff ¬†¬† 1.82ns ¬†¬†¬†¬† 5.69ns

¬†¬†¬† NAND2\_3X ¬†¬† 0.3 ¬†¬† 2.11ff ¬†¬† 2.48ns ¬†¬†¬†¬† 8.17ns

**Total Delay = Delay of Cell + Delay of Previous stage**

So, in our case,

¬†¬†¬† Delay of AND1\_2X = 1.50ns + 0ns = **1.50ns**

¬†¬†¬† Delay of AND2\_3X = 2.37ns + 1.50ns = **3.87ns**

¬†¬†¬† Delay of AND2\_4X = 1.82ns + 3.87ns = **5.69ns**

¬†¬†¬† Delay of NAND2\_3X = 2.48ns + 5.69ns = **8.17ns**

**Note:**

- All the above calculations, you have to do with in TCL Program.
- You have to reuse TCL program of Task 1.

 - Reading of File "file\_input1.txt" should be with the help of previous program only.
 - Rearranging the data should be using previous program.
 - Writing data should be as per previous program.

Step 4: Print the above formated data onto the terminal & in output file "file\_output2.txt"

**Learning after this Program:**

- How to Open & Close 2 Input files simultaneously
- How to Read or Write from/in a file
- How to save data in List and do different operation on that
- How to do Matching or say comparison of Data
- How to select only a specific data
- How to do mathematical calculations
- Different commands use-model

 - list, lindex, lappend
 - Foreach loop, While loop, If-else loop
 - gets and puts
 - split
 - expr
 - incr

- How to manage single space, multiple space
- Regular expression concepts
- Procedure concepts (proc in tcl)

 - How to write a Procedure
 - How to pass a value to Procedure
 - How to call a Procedure
 - How to get return from a Procedure (return command)

**Industrial Use of this Task:**

Most of the time, we work on automation of data in Industry.This data present in the form of report file (.rpt file) or output file or may be logfile. After reading data, we have to do a lot of operation (mathematically) and has to represent the data as per our requirement.

For example,

1. Timing Report have a lot of information about several Timing paths. You may have to create a automation to find out only slack of specific paths mentioned in other file.
2. SPEF file has C (cap) information of Nets. You want to compare 2 SPEF files of same design generated after making certain changes in design. This type of automation create a final report of Delta Cap for all Nets present in either SPEF file. Analysis of this final report (created after automation) may help you to fix design issues.

There are lot of such examples. I will try to list those sometime later. :)

I am sure this article will help you. In the Next article, we will discuss about a task where you have to take inputs from user in runtime (means during the execution of Program).

### [TCL Practice Task 1 (Scripting Language)](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/11/tcl-practice-task-1.html)

VLSI Industry has requirement of TCL (a scripting language). Lot of Institutes helping students to learn this language. But somehow students don't know much about the use of this in real VLSI World. In this article, I am listing down few of the small projects or say programs or exercise which you should try at least once before entering into the VLSI Industry. If you are able to automate below few task, more then 50% of work (based on TCL) can be done easily.

**Task 1:- Input Output File Handling & Rearranging Data**

Step 1: Create a file and named it "file\_input1.txt" (Content of "file\_input1.txt" is given below - Remember, you have create file exactly same as given. All spaces and format should be in same manner)

**Input File:** ‚Äúfile\_input1.txt‚Äù

¬†¬†¬† Name ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Delay ¬†¬† Trans ¬†¬† Load

¬†¬†¬† ---------------------------------------------

¬†¬†¬† AND2\_4X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 1.82ns ¬†¬† 0.5 ¬†¬† 2.54ff

¬†¬†¬† NAND1\_2X ¬†¬† 2.14ns ¬†¬† 0.2 ¬†¬† 1.69ff

¬†¬†¬† NAND2\_3X ¬†¬† 2.48ns ¬†¬† 0.3 ¬†¬† 2.11ff

Step 2: Create a TCL based program which will read input file ("file\_input1.txt) and rearrange the data as per below format.

¬†¬†¬† Name ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Trans ¬†¬† Load ¬†¬† Delay

¬†¬†¬† ---------------------------------------------

¬†¬†¬† AND1\_2X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 0.1 ¬†¬† 1.25ff ¬†¬† 1.50ns

¬†¬†¬† AND1\_3X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 0.2 ¬†¬† 1.98ff ¬†¬† 1.75ns

¬†¬†¬† AND2\_3X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 0.3 ¬†¬† 2.27ff ¬†¬† 2.37ns

¬†¬†¬† AND2\_4X ¬†¬†¬†¬† 0.5 ¬†¬† 2.54ff ¬†¬† 1.82ns

¬†¬†¬† NAND1\_2X ¬†¬† 0.2 ¬†¬† 1.69ff ¬†¬† 2.14ns

¬†¬†¬† NAND2\_3X ¬†¬† 0.3 ¬†¬† 2.11ff ¬†¬† 2.48ns

Step 3: Print the above formated data onto the terminal & in output file "file\_output.txt"

**Learning after completion of this task:**

- How to Open and Close file
- How to Read or Write from/in a file
- How to save data in List and do different operation on that
- Different commands usemodel

 - list, lindex, lappend
 - Foreach loop, While loop, If-else loop
 - gets and puts
 - split

- How to manage single space, multiple space
- If you are using regular expression - then things will be different but as such this program can be written without any regular expression.
- If you are new to Linus environment then few more learning after this task

 - How to write a file using any unix editor
 - How to source a file and execute a program

- If you want to use Procedure (equivalent to functions in C)

 - How to write a Procedure
 - How to pass a value to Procedure
 - How to call a Procedure

**Industrial Use of this Task:**

Most of the time, we work on automation of data in Industry.This data present in the form of report file (.rpt file) or output file or may be logfile. After reading data, we have to rearrange that data as per required format or say template (may be because of any other tool requirement or other scripting requirement or creating graphs/charts etc.)

I am sure, it will help you. In the Next article, we will discuss another Task with multiple file handling and data comparing concepts.

### [The Job Before the Job ‚Äì How to Write a Killer Resume](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/09/how-to-write-killer-resume.html)

**Author Article: (By Lucy Wyndham)**

Those looking to get into the world of
semiconductor engineering are facing one of the most competitive job markets
out there. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, [the projected market growth](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/materials-engineers.htm) for
materials engineers is only 2% between now and 2026. This stat may sound as
intimidating [as an interviewer‚Äôs questions](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/p/here-i-are-trying-to-capture-most-of.html), but
don‚Äôt worry. This just means you need to prepare for the career as thoroughly
as possible, and this starts with writing an irresistible resume.

**The**
**Basics**

Errors have always been resume-killers.
One misspelling here or glaring grammatical gaffe there is oftentimes all it
takes for a resume to get tossed in the wastebasket. When you‚Äôve typed up a
resume, [carefully proofread it and fix](https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/Proofreading.html) all
the errors you spot. When you‚Äôre done, comb over it again ‚Äì chances are you
missed something. Not doing so could kill your hopes before they even spring
forth.

A good-looking resume is more than just
making sure there aren‚Äôt any mistakes, though. It must be easy to read and
possess an agreeable aesthetic flow. Use a legible font that‚Äôs sized to allow
for a decent amount of white space on the page, as that will make it easier to
read. Also, stick to white or cream-colored paper, as it‚Äôs very difficult to
take a resume on colored paper seriously.

Additionally, don‚Äôt fudge. This not only
includes your qualifications or your past job info, but also your [technical skills and proficiencies](https://novoresume.com/resume-templates).
If a job is asking for, say, Excel skills, this means they are going to expect
you to work with a spreadsheet. This could be a problem if you don‚Äôt know what
you‚Äôre doing.

**Modern**
**Tips**

Because of the Internet and the power of
social media, it‚Äôs not enough to just build your resume with achievements and
proficiencies. You need to have an online presence. Studies show a whopping 93%
of recruiters will seek out your online profiles before making the call to
interview you.

Therefore, be proactive here and put your
social media links on your resume. Putting a link to your LinkedIn site, for
instance, will make your resume more appealing. After all, nobody will have to
poke around the net trying to figure you out.

Following these tips won‚Äôt necessarily
guarantee a phone call from a potential employer. However, they will increase
the likeliness of your resume getting noticed and considered. That may seem
like a small step, but considering the competitiveness of the semiconductor
engineering job market, it‚Äôs an important step to take.

### [Digital Electronics - Mux Based Interview Questions](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/05/digital-electronics-mux-based-interview.html)

As a fresher or experienced candidate, digital electronics always play an important role in VLSI Interview. Whatever be the profile, it doesn't matter. Lot of candidates call me or message me and ask

- What type of questions can be asked in Digital electronics ?
- Which book/s is/are good for preparation?
- What all topics should be cover ?

and lot more such type of questions.

It's very difficult to answer such questions because Digital electronics is so vast that no one can cover it 100% with in 1 month (max time we get before any interview). So what's the best way to prepare. I am capturing few topics from Digital electronics one by one which looks to me very important. I am also trying to capture questions which can be asked by any Interviewer. If you can focus on these topics or say questions - I am sure - it will give you a good amount of confidence for any Interview.

**Note: At the end, I am trying to capture few common mistakes, more than 50% candidates do during interviews. I hope, it will help all of you to get the right answer and understand the expectation of Interviewer.**

## Multiplexer based Interview Questions:

01. Describe the operation of Multiplexer
02. How many select lines are there for 12 : 1 MUX ?
03. How many input pins are there in a 2:1 MUX ?
04. How can we convert 4:1 Mux into 2:1 Mux ?

 1. Any other method for converting 4:1MUX to 2:1, where no need to short "Select line" ?

06. How many 2:1 MUX require to make 16:1 MUX ?

There can be more questions but unfortunately, not able to recall them. Anyone has any other questions - please help me to add here. Else, I will update this list whenever I am able to recall. :)

## Common Mistakes in Different Questions:

**Common Mistake Related to Question 1:**

While explaining the operation of Mux, candidates generally miss "select lines". If Interviewer ask to draw the diagram of MUX, candidates draw diagram without proper labelling. This is the area where anyone can confuse you. See below symbols & try to understand why I have mentioned correct or wrong.

**Common Mistake Related to Question 3:**

Very common Answer is 2 which is not correct. Why? Check .lib file.

**Common Mistake Related to Question 4:**

Solution is very simple - Connect both the select line or say short both the select line. But common mistake - we miss to make changes in the labelling.

**Common Mistake Related to Question 5**

- Candidates become confuse between Decoder method and Mux method. :)
- Most of the Candidates confuse at the labelling part.

**Common Mistake Related to Question 7**

Normally, in college text books (or say basic Digital Electronics Books) - internal circuit is based on AND gate. So, we start with the AND gate based circuit of MUX and then convert respective AND gate with MOS. But actually, Interviewer need to know Pass Transistor or say Transmission gate based MUX. :)

**Common Mistake Related to Question 8**

Usually, we gave single answer but actually it depends how we have implemented MUX. Means using CMOS or Only NMOS/PMOS.

**Common Mistake Related to Question 9**

Usually we draw a single circuit, which we have learnt. But we miss to draw truth table and then implement using MUX. If you use this approach - you can implement any logic gate using MUX. Interviewer, also see your approach and need to understand whether you know the concepts or method or you have just mugged it.

Happy Learning and Best of Luck.

### [Logic Level & Noise Margin](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/02/logic-level-noise-margin.html)

Today, we will talk about the logic levels and what‚Äôs all this. I came across several students and realize that they are struggling big time to understand the Logic level, Input-output logic level and all.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh21qsQgzHL7C45mNieus_oZiugRCe2x-dM44Pza_GgFq5VxwYYy7zjDnAPsX3PuvlDfUWYR-tuisx7kJRdn0UiwpL6-tnx3RbIiNBCEWiGJfZQ0SnDlSCvRC09xiujGxhTZGg2gMpBp6o/s400/Logic+Level.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh21qsQgzHL7C45mNieus_oZiugRCe2x-dM44Pza_GgFq5VxwYYy7zjDnAPsX3PuvlDfUWYR-tuisx7kJRdn0UiwpL6-tnx3RbIiNBCEWiGJfZQ0SnDlSCvRC09xiujGxhTZGg2gMpBp6o/s1600/Logic+Level.PNG)

Let‚Äôs start with above known logic level diagram. Here, you can see that range of signal for Logic 0 is 0V to 1V and similarly for Logic 1 ‚Äì It‚Äôs 2V to 3V, Till this point, everyone is (should be) clear. But the moment I ask what‚Äôs between Logic 1 and Logic 0 ‚Äì confusion start. Few says it‚Äôs Undefined region and few smart kid says ‚Äì it‚Äôs Noise Margin. :) The moment I ask them to define or provide more insight about this Noise region (as per smart kid), none of them able to define it. :)

In this article, we will discuss about this region and more related concepts.

Remember, everything above is with respect to Positive Logic Level and same we will discuss through out this article. To understand what‚Äôs Positive Logic Level and Negative Logic Level ‚Äì please refer [Digital Basic (Logic Gates ‚Äì Part a)](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2013/12/digital-basic-13-logic-gates-part-a.html).

## Voltage Logic Level (Input/Output)

Let's try to understand the **Logic Level at the Input and Output of a Gate.**

Logic Level at the input of the Gate is known as **Input Logic Level** and corresponding voltage range as:

- **Logic 1: Start from VIH (Minimum Input Voltage for Logic High) and Ends at VDD**
- **Logic 0: Start from VSS and Ends at VIL (Maximum Input Voltage for Logic Low)**

Logic Level at the output of the Gate is known as **Output Logic Level** and corresponding voltage range as:

- **Logic 1: Start from VOH (Minimum Output Voltage for Logic High) and Ends at VDD**
- **Logic 0: Start from VSS and Ends at VOL (Maximum Output Voltage for Logic Low)**

Below Figure, can help you to understand what I am talking about...

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjp5qqLjYeq4ZxGUK_sS1_3CkxuOSfk9iuaroZfn4iKhyphenhyphenuL9eWU9ldOnHCEm9eh1CUW3iU9bdIT-EcpYwEm92mKOKwXyj36iZjgUBKfmONaSO2wTjadXPMuFZnPma5bwa7jshs5hQY7Py4/s640/Input-Output-Logic-Level.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjp5qqLjYeq4ZxGUK_sS1_3CkxuOSfk9iuaroZfn4iKhyphenhyphenuL9eWU9ldOnHCEm9eh1CUW3iU9bdIT-EcpYwEm92mKOKwXyj36iZjgUBKfmONaSO2wTjadXPMuFZnPma5bwa7jshs5hQY7Py4/s1600/Input-Output-Logic-Level.PNG)

Now, as a difference, you can see both (Input and Output Logic levels) have voltage range for Logic 1 & Logic 0. So **Next question is**:

- Are VOH = VIH and VOL = VIL ??
- What's the relationship between different voltage level? ??

You have to justify your answer with proper reason. Let me try from my side :) with logical explanation.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8HXW5OtICCu70OgTyAulAzEg1P6Km5G3D9e1-605fDfkrrNcUcQtMlEUyApI-qBZqdSDh8TCsxll1YF1-IJH3t6I8o-lmQWcMzBoLnli9o4Z-Y1e50TUmse3POhEuZ0C1eK87EmVISU8/s400/Logic+propagation+Output+to+Input.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8HXW5OtICCu70OgTyAulAzEg1P6Km5G3D9e1-605fDfkrrNcUcQtMlEUyApI-qBZqdSDh8TCsxll1YF1-IJH3t6I8o-lmQWcMzBoLnli9o4Z-Y1e50TUmse3POhEuZ0C1eK87EmVISU8/s1600/Logic+propagation+Output+to+Input.PNG)

In above fig, 2 NAND gates (1 & 2) are connected back to back. Let‚Äôs consider both NAND gates are 100% similar. If, NET Delay is Zero, **Our Expectation is** :: **Any signal at the output of ‚ÄúGate1 with Logic 1‚Äù should be identify as ‚ÄúLogic 1 at the Input of Gate2‚Äù. Same goes with Logic 0 also.** Let's try to understand with example (if helps you to understand more clearly).

**Scenario 1:** **VOH < VIH ; VDD = 5V, VOH = 3V, VIL = 1V, VIH = 4V**

- **Output Logic 1**

 - Voltage range of Output Logic 1 is between 3V to 5V.
 - It means any signal with a voltage value between 3V and 5V is consider as Logic 1 at the output pin of Gate1.

- **Input Logic 1**

 - Voltage range of Input Logic 1 is between 4V to 5V.
 - It means any signal with a voltage value between 4V and 5V is considered as Logic 1.
 - **Any signal below 4V is NOT considered as part of Logic 1.**

Now, assume that a signal coming out from Gate 1 has voltage = 3V. It‚Äôs consider as part of Logic 1 for Gate 1 but when this signal propagate and reach at input of Gate 2, it will be nowhere (Means neither 1 nor 0 because voltage range of Logic 1 start from 4V and voltage range of Logic 0 ends at 1V).

So, in this Ideal scenario (Ideal means No Net Voltage Drop), to capture the Logic 1 at the input of Gate 2, Output voltage of Gate 1 for Logic 1 should have below condition.

**VOH ‚â• VIH**

**Scenario 2:** **VOL ‚â• VIL ; VSS = 0V, VOL = 2V, VIL = 1V, VIH = 4V**

- **Output Logic 0**

 - Voltage range of Output Logic 0 is between 0V to 2V.
 - It means any signal with a voltage value between 0V and 2V is consider as Logic 0.

- **Input Logic 0**

 - Voltage range of Input Logic 0 is between 0V to 1V.
 - It means any signal with a voltage value between 0V and 1V is considered as Logic 0.
 - **Any signal above 1V is not considered as part of Logic 0.**

Now, assume that a signal coming out from Gate 1 has voltage = 2V. It‚Äôs consider as part of Logic 0 for Gate 1 but when this signal propagate and reach at input of Gate 2, it will be nowhere (Means neither 1 nor 0 because voltage range of Logic 0 ends at 1V and voltage range of Logic 1 start from 4V).

So in this Ideal scenario (Ideal means No Net Voltage Drop), to capture the Logic 0 at the input of Gate 2, Output voltage of Gate 1 for Logic 0 should have below condition.

**VOL ‚â§ VIL**

On the basic of above 2 scenarios, I can easily summarize that ...

**VOH ‚â• VIH**

**VOL ‚â§ VIL**

In above example, we have discussed all between 2 different gates (Output logic of 1st Gate and Input Logic of 2nd) and you may be thinking on the basis we summarize this relationship (because original question was Input Logic Vs Output Logic of Same Gate :)). Just in case, if that‚Äôs your confusion ‚Äì then check again ‚Äì I have mentioned above that both gates are identical (so it means input logic levels of 2nd Gate == Input Logic Levels of 1st Gate also. :):) ).

On the basis of this, if anyone give you below 4 options and ask you which one is the right set of Input-Output Logic combination ‚Äì I am sure , it will be easy to find out. (I am not going to give answer, you can write in comment section with reason :) ).

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1Xp2x7oNp1rB9COtOpMP4oiUNloH927GWtYBEBTET4dTN6g9aXCBM0rbRA0Y8pdN10RDEOJS_B6UofZulhIbstyLsFipF113XYwK-eq4r4nCyzMRC7tx0013LVdROdOvyMW2MxAD5E48/s640/Input-Output-Logic-Level-question.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1Xp2x7oNp1rB9COtOpMP4oiUNloH927GWtYBEBTET4dTN6g9aXCBM0rbRA0Y8pdN10RDEOJS_B6UofZulhIbstyLsFipF113XYwK-eq4r4nCyzMRC7tx0013LVdROdOvyMW2MxAD5E48/s1600/Input-Output-Logic-Level-question.PNG)

Till now, we considered the Ideal scenario (NO voltage drop across NET) But as you know nothing is ideal in this world, so keeping that in mind ‚Äì our conditions changes and in **real world condition will be**‚Ä¶.

### **VOH \> VIH** **VOL < VIL**

Now, If I want to represent this In a single diagram ‚Äì below is the representation.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeuD3NPTvC1tmn7EgsuvHmreqokSTE7zhUaJz_W58qbwr1RDQVhxmXFPrkDUNvqRomgjMVTkSu-y5ZFkZj6zKJjRzgJvwNac44t4b233IfN9pbzPDsc38nVIX70p3QQlJGDmueql7Yrbk/s400/Logic+level+2.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeuD3NPTvC1tmn7EgsuvHmreqokSTE7zhUaJz_W58qbwr1RDQVhxmXFPrkDUNvqRomgjMVTkSu-y5ZFkZj6zKJjRzgJvwNac44t4b233IfN9pbzPDsc38nVIX70p3QQlJGDmueql7Yrbk/s1600/Logic+level+2.PNG)

Okay, so till now we are able to understand different nomenclature, Like VOH , VIH , VOL , VIL in logic level, their importance and relationship between them.

Now, if you remember, our discussion started with 2 things ‚Äì Undefined Region and Noise Margin...

## Noise Region and Undefined Region

To understand the Noise Margin, you have to first understand what a "Noise" can do! In general, we can categorize Noise in 2 ways

- Noise Inside the Gate

 - Noise inside the Gate already taken care during simulation of Gate & only after that we define (or conclude) VOH, VOL

- Noise Outside the Gate

 - This Noise effects the signal which is traveling from the output pin of a gate to input pin to other gate

Let's talk about the Noise which developed or generated because of environment and effect Signal traveling between input and output pin of a Gate.

In general, Noise is Random in nature and you can‚Äôt model it exactly (at least the source of Noise :)). This Noise can be positive or negative in nature (when I am saying positive/negative it means with respect to zero reference level). It means if there is a output signal of 4V and suddenly a positive noise of 0.5V come, signal convert into 4.5V. Similarly, if Negative Noise of 0.5V come, output signal convert into 3.5V.

Let‚Äôs consider a scenario,

**For Gate 2:** VOH = 4V, VIH = 3.5V,

**Output signal from the 1st Gate is of 4V.**

Now, question is **what should be the maximum Noise value (in terms of voltage), so that even after noise 2nd Gate identify Logic 1 correctly ?**

As, we have discussed Noise can be Positive and Negative also ‚Äì

If Noise is Positive then it‚Äôs going to add in output voltage .. Means output is going to increase above 4V, which is okay for 2nd gate because for 2nd Gate Voltage range start for Logic level 1 is above 3.5V.

If Noise is Negative then it‚Äôs going to reduce output voltage .. It means output is going to decrease & value will be less the 4V. If that‚Äôs the case we have to understand that Voltage range for Input logic High (1) start from 3.5V. Any signal less then 3.5V is not considered as Logic 1 signal at the input of Gate2. So, I can easily say that in this scenario, **Maximum allowable Noise in negative side is 4V ‚Äì 3.5V = 0.5V** or you can say that **VOH ‚Äì VIH**. This difference we are saying NOISE MARGIN for LOGIC HIGH.

**NOISE MARGIN HIGH LOGIC = VOH ‚Äì VIH**

With the similar explanation, I can easily say that in case of Logic 0, any noise which increases the voltage of output logic signal beyond Max input Voltage for Logic 0, consider as not acceptable Noise. So, **any Noise between VOL and VIL is acceptable for Logic 0.** Means..

**NOISE MARGIN LOW LOGIC = VIL ‚Äì VOL**

Okay, so if this is the NOISE Margin, what‚Äôs the Undefined Region ? Answer is simple ‚Äì Remaining portion is considered as Undefined Region. :)

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh56T8Xe8O2-gTudM5BCZRZ63J0w4pMJNyzkstpRrQ3LaMJibqDV2a2FMQV2T-qgwgLuub9JRO11NeXeVs_XUkUNu0gMi3vWv8maC1VUS60s6t0AkvMIGcC98hNY_faCMTZvNWAf4IAuj0/s400/Noise+Margin.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh56T8Xe8O2-gTudM5BCZRZ63J0w4pMJNyzkstpRrQ3LaMJibqDV2a2FMQV2T-qgwgLuub9JRO11NeXeVs_XUkUNu0gMi3vWv8maC1VUS60s6t0AkvMIGcC98hNY_faCMTZvNWAf4IAuj0/s1600/Noise+Margin.PNG)

I know, now you may be thinking that above description is good when we talk in terms of Input Vs Output Logic Level. But If we talk only about Logic level (Individual), then how can we defined the region between ‚ÄúMin Voltage for Logic 1‚Äù and ‚ÄúMax Voltage for Logic 0‚Äù.

Any signal with in this range is considered as uncertain, and no one is going to give you guarantee how other Gate (input Gate) would interpret such signal because that depends on Input level of 2nd gate :). Now, if your other gate (gate which is going to receive this signal at input port) has wider voltage range for Logic 1 or 0, most of your signals between uncertain range can be consider either Logic 0 or Logic 1.

So, This region is considered as **Uncertain Region**. It means signal in this region can be consider as Logic 0 or 1 depends on Logic level Range of Next stage Input gate. I will not say that it‚Äôs Undefined Region because undefined means ‚Äì It's neither be 0 nor 1.

**Note:** "Either be 0 or 1" is completely different from "Neither be 0 nor 1".

If you are not clear with my statement ‚Äì let's try to understand with one more example of say scenario.:).

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2GWa3hnreV1XRRrf0kZHXbi9LbwiKu6aUtkaFwHQ85L-6TrZhpPvKi94T-ZNSv38leX-m1woTJIvB5fj3upHLu8jgJcP9ZErmz2TXen6kyCelaSqXQzd5RDdmQS4T9sOKO10RsVnW2iY/s400/Uncertain+Region+Vs+Undefined+Region.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2GWa3hnreV1XRRrf0kZHXbi9LbwiKu6aUtkaFwHQ85L-6TrZhpPvKi94T-ZNSv38leX-m1woTJIvB5fj3upHLu8jgJcP9ZErmz2TXen6kyCelaSqXQzd5RDdmQS4T9sOKO10RsVnW2iY/s1600/Uncertain+Region+Vs+Undefined+Region.PNG)

In above circuit, output of NAND Gate‚Äú1‚Äù is connected with 2 another NAND Gates. All NAND gates are different.

**Input Logic Level of NAND 2:**

Logic 0 ‚Äì From 0V to 2V

Logic 1 ‚Äì From 3V to 5V

**Input Logic Level of NAND 3:**

Logic 0 ‚Äì From 0V to 1.5V

Logic 1 ‚Äì From 3.5V to 5V.

**Output Logic Level of NAND 1:**

Logic 0 ‚Äì From 0V to 1V

Logic 1 ‚Äì From 4V to 5V.

Let‚Äôs assume At a particular instance, the output signal voltage at NAND Gate 1 is 3.2V. As per Output voltage levels (as per our above discussion), it‚Äôs in Uncertain Area. When this signal propagate through wire & reaches at

- **NAND Gate 3**

 - It‚Äôs below Voltage range for Logic level 1 (3.5V to 5V)
 - And above Voltage range for Logic level 0 (0V to 1.5V)
 - So this signal is considered as part of **UNDEFINED Region**.

- **NAND Gate 2**

 - It‚Äôs above Voltage range for Logic level 1 (3V to 5V)
 - So, this signal is considered as part of **Logic 1**.

So, it means **Same voltage can be part of Undefined Region and also as part of Logic Level 1.**Same case can happen for Logic 0 also.

**## In Summary:**

**- Range between VOH and VOL can be consider as uncertain range with respect to that gate.**
**- A range between VIH and VIL is considered as undefined region for that particular gate.**
**- Undefined region is with respect to Input Signal range.**
**- Uncertain Region is with respect to Output Signal Logic Range**
**- Noise Margin always with respect to Input and Output Logic range. :)**

### **VOH \> VIH** **VOL < VIL** NOISE MARGIN HIGH LOGIC = VOH ‚Äì VIH NOISE MARGIN LOW LOGIC = VIL ‚Äì VOL

I hope this article will help you to understand the Logic Level concepts in much more depth and help everyone (Specially Students) to understand the concepts :).

**HAPPY LEARNING**

### [Unateness of Complex Circuit: Timing Arc](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/01/unateness-of-complex-circuit-timing-arc.html)

## Monday, January 1, 2018

### [AOI (AND-OR-INVERTER) Cell](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/01/aoi-and-or-inverter-cell.html)

AOI also known as AND-OR-Inverter.

AND-OR-Invert (AOI) logic or say gates are two-level logic functions constructed from the combination of one or more AND gates followed by a NOR gate. If we construct AND, OR and NOT gate separately, Number of transistor in AOI gates are less.

You might be thinking why need individual logic gate, why can't we implement it using just 2 AND gate and 1 NOR gate. Yes, you are right. But now think from CMOS point of view. In CMOS, we can implement AND gate using 1 CMOS NAND gate and 1 Inverter. It means above 2 AND gate changes into 2 NAND and 2 Inverter. I hope this explanation rang a bell in your mind. If not, keep patience (this is only I am going to explain in this article :) ).

Let's take an example and try to understand it.

**For example: 2-2 AOI gate: ((A.B) + (C.D))'**

Let's see how this function be implemented using logic gates (separately) Vs AOI cells.

Function (((A.B)')' + ((C.D)')')' can be implemented as:

- NAND Gates:

 - 2 NAND gates: 1st for (A.B)' and 2nd for (C.D)' (Assume X=(A.B)' and Y=(C.D)')
 - 1 NAND gate uses 2 PMOS transistor and 2 NMOS transistor.
 - So, total Transistors in **2 2-input NAND gate are 8 Transistors.**

- Inverter:

 - 2 Inverter: 1st (X)' and 2nd for (Y)'
 - 1 Inverter uses 1 PMOS and 1 NMOS
 - So, total Transistors in **1 Inverter are 2 Transistors.**

- NOR Gates:

 - 1 NOR Gate: (X' + Y')'
 - 1 NOR gate uses 2 PMOS transistor and 2 NMOS transistor.
 - So, total Transistors in 1 2-input NOR gate are 4 Transistors.

**Total Transistor in case of Individually implementing ((A.B) + (C.D))' = 14 Transistor.**

CMOS Representation of above function is given below.

**Using AOI logic gates.**

Below diagram can help you to understand how cells can implement using CMOS. In this case, total Transistor require are 8 Transistor. If you are not able to understand this part (I am sure you need to refresh your concept for CMOS circuit).

From above explanation, I am sure you are now in position to understand the importance of AOI cells. These cells are so important that in Standard cell library, you can easily find these cells (as other logic gates). So in short, I can say that these are also part of STANDARD Cells (So don't assume that only NAND, AND, OR, Buffer, Inverter, XOR, XNOR are Standard cells).

In a similar fashion, you can take any example and try to understand how many transistors are required in case of implementing that function in AOI form. This type of questions are very common during Interview or Written test.

**Less number of Transistors for implementing a particular logic function helps in multiple ways.** Like

- **Increased speed:** Less transistor means less delay, means fast response time.
- **Reduced Power:** Less number of transistor means less power consumption.
- **Smaller area:** Less number of transistor means less area consumption.
- **Potentially lower fabrication cost:** Fabrication cost is also less because of less number of manufacturing of transistor.

You can also understand OAI cells in similar way OR if you are not able to .. then wait for my Article. :)

### [AOI (AND-OR-INVERTER) Cell](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2018/01/aoi-and-or-inverter-cell.html)

AOI also known as AND-OR-Inverter.

AND-OR-Invert (AOI) logic or say gates are two-level logic functions constructed from the combination of one or more AND gates followed by a NOR gate. If we construct AND, OR and NOT gate separately, Number of transistor in AOI gates are less.

You might be thinking why need individual logic gate, why can't we implement it using just 2 AND gate and 1 NOR gate. Yes, you are right. But now think from CMOS point of view. In CMOS, we can implement AND gate using 1 CMOS NAND gate and 1 Inverter. It means above 2 AND gate changes into 2 NAND and 2 Inverter. I hope this explanation rang a bell in your mind. If not, keep patience (this is only I am going to explain in this article :) ).

Let's take an example and try to understand it.

**For example: 2-2 AOI gate: ((A.B) + (C.D))'**

Let's see how this function be implemented using logic gates (separately) Vs AOI cells.

**Using Individual NAND, NOT and NOR Gate:**

First we have to change the function as per logic gates availability. Y== ((A.B) + (C.D))' == (((A.B)')' + ((C.D)')')'

Function (((A.B)')' + ((C.D)')')' can be implemented as:

- NAND Gates:

 - 2 NAND gates: 1st for (A.B)' and 2nd for (C.D)' (Assume X=(A.B)' and Y=(C.D)')
 - 1 NAND gate uses 2 PMOS transistor and 2 NMOS transistor.
 - So, total Transistors in **2 2-input NAND gate are 8 Transistors.**

- Inverter:

 - 2 Inverter: 1st (X)' and 2nd for (Y)'
 - 1 Inverter uses 1 PMOS and 1 NMOS
 - So, total Transistors in **1 Inverter are 2 Transistors.**

- NOR Gates:

 - 1 NOR Gate: (X' + Y')'
 - 1 NOR gate uses 2 PMOS transistor and 2 NMOS transistor.
 - So, total Transistors in 1 2-input NOR gate are 4 Transistors.

**Total Transistor in case of Individually implementing ((A.B) + (C.D))' = 14 Transistor.**

### [Metal Layer Stack (Nomenclature) Part 2](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/10/metal-layer-stack-nomenclature-part-2.html)

In the last part we have discussed about the Metal Stack. The way foundry provide data, different restrictions and available options. Now it's time to understand the very next step - how to communicate the complex Metal Stack information across the design team or groups or companies. For this Foundry also provide Nomenclature of metal stack.

If you remember in the last article we have discussed that there are different metal wires like Mx, My, Mz, Mr , Mu, etc (in XYZ Foundry). Below diagram can help you to remind this very well.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjccLBKxRsJ28WtqOBk17v4p28O0BePLfhiiP2cPmPlHRILZkvJmIryMg4zv_AP13X-yYoMF-ynKsMBlmmF1SdwLRDc9Fp0YJYSeBQCmu9Xjop16O9EdlF6DGNr7J_B2JoCTv_M3PeZgwM/s640/metalization+option+1.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjccLBKxRsJ28WtqOBk17v4p28O0BePLfhiiP2cPmPlHRILZkvJmIryMg4zv_AP13X-yYoMF-ynKsMBlmmF1SdwLRDc9Fp0YJYSeBQCmu9Xjop16O9EdlF6DGNr7J_B2JoCTv_M3PeZgwM/s1600/metalization+option+1.PNG)

Now, lets suppose you want to use Stack type 7 and same you want to communicate to other user, then there is a standard way for this. (You might be thinking that I will communicate directly that you are referring Stack type 7. But if we do this - every time user has to refer this table to understand different metal layer optons. :) ).

If you will check closely the Stack Type 7, you will find below information.

- There are Total 6 metal layers.
- Metal 1 is of M1 type.
- Metal 2, 3, 4 are of Mx type. Means next 3 Metal layers (After M1) are of Mx type.
- Metal 5 is of My type. Means next 1 metal layer (after Mx) is of is of My type.
- Metal 6 is of Mz type. Means next 1 metal layer (after My) is of is of Mz type.

Now, if I combine all this information and write something like this.

**M1\_3Mx\_My\_Mz : 1 (M1 Type) + 3 (Mx type) + 1 (My Type) + 1 (Mz Type) = 6 Metal layer.**

Between 2 metal layers (e.g M1 and M2) - we will use VIA as per upper metal layer type (e.g Vx type)

The way I have defined the sequence also help to understand the sequence of Metal layer.

Any one can now interpret that :

**Metal 1** = M1

**Metal 2** = Mx1 (Mx Type)

**Metal 3** = Mx2 (Mx Type)

**Metal 4** = Mx3 (Mx Type)

**Metal 5** = My1 (My Type)

**Metal 6** = Mz1 (Mz Type)

**VIA 1** = Vx1 (Vx type)

**VIA 2** = Vx1 (Vx type)

**VIA 3** = Vx1 (Vx type)

**VIA 4** = Vx1 (Vy type)

**VIA 5** = Vx1 (Vz type)

Remember, number of VIAs are always 1 less then the number of Metal layers. :)

Different companies uses different way to understand this. Like following are few examples.

1. **M1\_3Mx\_My\_Mz** : 1 (M1 Type) + 3 (Mx type) + 1 (My Type) + 1 (Mz Type) = 6 Metal layer.
2. **3Mx\_My\_Mz** : 1 (M1 Type) + 3 (Mx type) + 1 (My Type) + 1 (Mz Type) = 6 Metal layer.
3. **3MxMyMz** : 1 (M1 Type) + 3 (Mx type) + 1 (My Type) + 1 (Mz Type) = 6 Metal layer.
4. **6M\_3MxMyMz** : 1 (M1 Type) + 3 (Mx type) + 1 (My Type) + 1 (Mz Type) = 6 Metal layer.
5. **1P6M\_3MxMyMz** : 1 (M1 Type) + 3 (Mx type) + 1 (My Type) + 1 (Mz Type) = 6 Metal layer.

**Note:**

- In the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th option, First Metal layer M1 is considered by default.
- In the 4th option, It was mentioned explicitly that stack has 6 metal layer (6M).
- In the 5th option, It was mentioned explicitly that stack has 1 Poly layer (1P) and 6 metal layer (6M).

For the above figure, I have added all the nomenclature as per 5th option. Also for your easiness, I have mentioned Stack name at the Top and Bottom (both places same information). I am sure, after this there will be no confusion. :)

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgfdhboS0P98-Svm6xMKOfqrWTHyhMVcJ23mOI9nSuwGrgqZRNHycIEBBY1OCo8RilLBdTLMfSvnVuVNVim-bPDvoaSXz-JRxgm29HkXD2TA5nH4kZcoUhM0C4Nh-rYChGlNiUYW4da7Aw/s640/metalization+option+3.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgfdhboS0P98-Svm6xMKOfqrWTHyhMVcJ23mOI9nSuwGrgqZRNHycIEBBY1OCo8RilLBdTLMfSvnVuVNVim-bPDvoaSXz-JRxgm29HkXD2TA5nH4kZcoUhM0C4Nh-rYChGlNiUYW4da7Aw/s1600/metalization+option+3.PNG)

In the last, I just wanted to highlight that above nomenclature and metal stack options is for 1 foundry. But different Foundries may have different ways to provide and representation their information. With in the companies or group or team, they can also decide their own way to represent Metal Stack but when they communicate with outside world, either they have to use certain standard or they have to provide details of their nomenclature (which is very common).

### [Metal Layer Stack (Metallization Option) Part 1](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/10/metal-layer-stack-metallization-option1.html)

There are different metal layers which we uses in our design. As we move down the technology node number of standard cells increases or you can say that number of connections increases drastically. As all of us know that these connection are made of Metal wire, it means number of metal wires increases. Below figure help you to understand the scenario.

**Case1** : I didn't decrease the size of the chip (despite change in the no of standard cells per unit area) as we go down the technology node. You can see that number of metal wires increases. Silicon utilization improves with improved routability. But these numbers (standard cell) increases 4 times (per node if we are decreases the size by 1/2, overall area decreases by 1/2\*1/2=1/4). With available options of metal wire in higher node, it's difficult to route the same design in lower technology node. And that's the reason as we go down number of metal wires increases (vertically also).

**Case 2**: This is the real scenario. As Technology node decreases, no of standard cells increases and also chip size decreases. So you can imagine how difficult it is to route the design with a single metal wire or say on a single level. That's the reason we have multiple levels of metal wires. These levels are in vertical direction. As we go down the technology node, these levels increases. So you can say that down the technology node, size of the chip decreases in one dimension (in 2D) but increases in other dimension (vertically). :) :)

### 27. ### Isotropic Etch Process:

**URL:** https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2014/07/
**Date:** 2014-07
**Tags:** physical-design, dft, parasitic

### Isotropic Etch Process:

In the Isotropic etch process etchant attacks the layer surfaces equally in all the directions.¬† Most of the liquid etchant are isotropic. Since etchant attacks in all the direction (horizontal and vertical both direction), the resultant layer shape is not as per the expectation. Below figure help you to understand.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6ohdOpttIXUBL-AYf-XIwo-1oXhwsuBBpjvTb0fYVdeyLBUPCCXQM5YUxCtP3tgY0KuV-G6qfqj0R-EtTsxa10mXVzfx83jdaBGhAnKFwxFHIrEGDArkl7jNpyAJjre1Nto4FD_rEIEY/s1600/Etching4.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6ohdOpttIXUBL-AYf-XIwo-1oXhwsuBBpjvTb0fYVdeyLBUPCCXQM5YUxCtP3tgY0KuV-G6qfqj0R-EtTsxa10mXVzfx83jdaBGhAnKFwxFHIrEGDArkl7jNpyAJjre1Nto4FD_rEIEY/s1600/Etching4.jpg)

You can see that the resultant layer become narrow in size. When the layer width and spacing is significantly larger than the thickness of the layer, Isotropic results a minor problem but when layer width and spacing is comparable to thickness of the layer then plasma etching technique which is capable of anisotropic etching is used (I will discuss this later in post).

As per the etchant solution, if amount of narrowing the feature in horizontal direction can be figured out, we can use compensation method to make it as ideal as possible. In the mask compensation method, the mask size is increased from the desired size of layer (which increase the width of deposited Resist) in such a way that after etching and stripping of Resist, resultant layer width becomes equal to (or approximately equal to) required size. But again this method can‚Äôt be used if thickness of layer is comparable to width/size of layer.

Below diagram helps you to understand the final result of isotropic etching in more detail.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxQ-hwznVommiw1JtwAQL1QL5HyuBH4zWfZorUzp4sr5Y1R__TJTwhlN_4jJvbe72EG-P7p6NllXVCTcFiNJGcg7pRloCkKnRk5nBIFdHLTe4ghH1nG213HfkLTRFqh-EVBg0hYBgQPPM/s1600/Etching5.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxQ-hwznVommiw1JtwAQL1QL5HyuBH4zWfZorUzp4sr5Y1R__TJTwhlN_4jJvbe72EG-P7p6NllXVCTcFiNJGcg7pRloCkKnRk5nBIFdHLTe4ghH1nG213HfkLTRFqh-EVBg0hYBgQPPM/s1600/Etching5.jpg)

Now correlate this with the actual process which we have discussed in the previous part. I have just changed the color so that you can understand this clearly.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWQbj0G-WvZr8Zg__1T6DRHATopMY6ouwfhqORIuQ3nvCNA9V_wE_OtGtAtMDPYCB0Kxv4XvWifZskfn-KlHGu7lV55x6BhkhjHm1WHo_PxU46yRgyfCYz2dioh80I_fbWoBiO0uXYhug/s1600/Etching2.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWQbj0G-WvZr8Zg__1T6DRHATopMY6ouwfhqORIuQ3nvCNA9V_wE_OtGtAtMDPYCB0Kxv4XvWifZskfn-KlHGu7lV55x6BhkhjHm1WHo_PxU46yRgyfCYz2dioh80I_fbWoBiO0uXYhug/s1600/Etching2.jpg)

### Anisotropic Etching Process:

As I have mentioned above, when layer width and spacing is comparable to thickness of the layer then plasma etching technique which is capable of anisotropic etching is used.¬† You can understand this with the following diagram.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghwQ658nRPdZHrH1XdulZWT_SEop8VrETMQqYaG65S_LeZWfz7n29EHlwg7SRd-5vwUMG4JDecIXV8QGif9Tw_XUgf57lAGNoJbfsvJUmXgn0f4CYjcoOaNlSWfua9I22XWj_kLUX__6I/s1600/Etching3.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghwQ658nRPdZHrH1XdulZWT_SEop8VrETMQqYaG65S_LeZWfz7n29EHlwg7SRd-5vwUMG4JDecIXV8QGif9Tw_XUgf57lAGNoJbfsvJUmXgn0f4CYjcoOaNlSWfua9I22XWj_kLUX__6I/s1600/Etching3.jpg)

The degree of Anisotropy of an etch process can be expressed as:

A = 1 ‚Äì Vh/Vv

Where

A = Degree of Anisotropy

Vh = horizontal Etch rate

Vv = Vertical Etch Rate

When A=0, it represent Isotropic etching and A=1 represent Anisotropic etching.

Remember, we always try to get A=1 but that‚Äôs the ideal scenario. :)¬†In the above diagram, I have mentioned Directional Etch and that‚Äôs the thing we can get practically. :)

You might be confused but below figures can remove your confusion (I captured these figures from Internet and then just modified little bit)

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6Wx60F2PDYWaUKSrHWeEUPU41iLzPEWwUdFyMH8xhQ2rr45Aw-_h_ACx_bAICU51Mgzr-S677cZHkn1osX3uHjpDWf7MufjN-HnHNjEVFAA2ZWUbX4r3hukySbfrQRFmcIWN0K72x-ss/s1600/Etching6.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6Wx60F2PDYWaUKSrHWeEUPU41iLzPEWwUdFyMH8xhQ2rr45Aw-_h_ACx_bAICU51Mgzr-S677cZHkn1osX3uHjpDWf7MufjN-HnHNjEVFAA2ZWUbX4r3hukySbfrQRFmcIWN0K72x-ss/s1600/Etching6.jpg)

From above you can see that in case of Isotropic ‚Äì Etch rate is same in all the direction, Anisotropic ‚Äì highly directional etching with different etch rate in different directions.

Now you may ask how this (isotropic and anisotropic) is going to affect differently our process, I will explain this again with the help of following fig (again from Internet).

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgenxlRI1K0m_hyphenhyphenOJtLjzGGYTr_2Zrvn2XoAa-d2LdHQdzjHKi5ByIYQUx1Ks-0tEHAtU2jrGsJgeDntETrcCK6ZTAVF66_GWqE6JFyFH5LRFa1akqwK2eUUdV7UWQ-VF182Qp5tm6RgGE/s1600/Etching7.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgenxlRI1K0m_hyphenhyphenOJtLjzGGYTr_2Zrvn2XoAa-d2LdHQdzjHKi5ByIYQUx1Ks-0tEHAtU2jrGsJgeDntETrcCK6ZTAVF66_GWqE6JFyFH5LRFa1akqwK2eUUdV7UWQ-VF182Qp5tm6RgGE/s1600/Etching7.jpg)

Here you can see that metal ‚ÄúBIAS‚Äù is different in different cases.

In case of Isotropic, we don‚Äôt have control in the horizontal direction. It‚Äôs equal in both direction and that‚Äôs the reason I have mentioned previously that if width is larger than thickness ‚Äì we can use Isotropic but when with is comparable to height, then if we use this process, then we will get very small (or almost zero) width of the layer (I hope you can imagine this).

In case of Anisotropic, we can control horizontal biasing/etching. And we always like those things which are in our control. J

**_From the Above discussion, It's clear that In the Width Variation of Metal or¬†Dielectric¬†- Etching has an Important role._**

I hope this much is sufficient to build a base of etching process effects. But before I will write my final words, I would like to touch few more things which are related to Etch process just in the form of Summary.

**What is ETCHING?**

As the name suggest it‚Äôs the process of removing something. In the semiconductor world ‚Äì It‚Äôs the process of chemically removing layers from the surface of wafer during manufacturing.

**Few things we have to remember:**

- Every wafer has to undergo with several etching steps.
- You can‚Äôt skip the Etching steps and none of the etching process is ideal.
- Depends on the type of Etching process, you are using ‚Äì type of defects are introduces in the chip and also depend the intensity of those defects.

**There are 2 type of etch process** (apart of Isotropic and Anisotropic ‚Äì which we have discussed above):

1. **Wet Etch**

 - Liquid Etchant
 - Chemical process Only
 - Advantage:

 - Low Cost and easy to implement
 - High etching rate
 - Good selectivity for most material.

 - Disadvantage:

 - Very hard to control critical feature Dimension
 - Eliminates Toxic fumes.

3. **Dry etch**

 - Gas Phase etchants in a plasma
 - Chemical and physical (sputtering) process
 - Advantage:

 - Both isotropic and anisotropic process can be done.
 - High resolution and cleanliness
 - Better process control
 - Ease of automation.

In the next part we will discuss one more effect of Etching and then the way foundry model these variation‚Äôs effects.

 Fantastic information. Really appreciate it. You succeeded in explaining what many tool manuals don't explain.

 I am only missing one thing in this blog, though. Giving an STA example from the point of view of one interface. E.g. we are designing an SPI slave controller which needs to interface an SPI master for which we have a timing diagram.

 I find extremely annoying the way timing diagrams are explained in datasheets, and how to match the different specs given there to the concepts (Ts and Th basically) you have introduced in the blog.

 Thanks

### [How To Read SDF (Standard Delay Format) - Part5](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2019/12/standard-delay-format-5.html)

In the last few articles ( [PART 1](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2011/03/how-to-read-sdf-standard-delay-format.html), [PART 2](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2011/03/how-to-read-sdf-standard-delay-format_16.html) and [PART 3](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2011/03/how-to-read-sdf-standard-delay-format_17.html)), we have discussed the following things

- SDF different sections and different construct - In [PART 2](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2011/03/how-to-read-sdf-standard-delay-format_16.html)
- Cell Section details - In [PART 3](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2011/03/how-to-read-sdf-standard-delay-format_17.html)
- Delay Details in SDF - In [PART 4](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2019/12/standard-delay-format-4.html)

Now. it's the time to discuss about the SDF using an example.

Lets discuss the below circuit.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-laVviWsQh8mcy7U_EPgQKg3L9qhgnZfpZ0Rcvu3rgA5ydy6MBbgou6SZ4dXs41l0HVc1BojP4Jq5nM6qU1il8hUfhgEyKZDpilFrKM28ZoClM1h2R_kOpTftCV9UEVSUkayGhrbRF7M/s400/example1.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-laVviWsQh8mcy7U_EPgQKg3L9qhgnZfpZ0Rcvu3rgA5ydy6MBbgou6SZ4dXs41l0HVc1BojP4Jq5nM6qU1il8hUfhgEyKZDpilFrKM28ZoClM1h2R_kOpTftCV9UEVSUkayGhrbRF7M/s1600/example1.PNG)

As a part of SDF, if you remember, we have discussed in [PART 2](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2011/03/how-to-read-sdf-standard-delay-format_16.html) \- that there is a HEADER section, Then CELL Section. In our circuit, there are 5 instance of Cells - r1, r2, r3, u1 & u2. These cells are mapped with Library as (This information you can get from .lib or from .v file)

**r1, r2 and r3 -> DFF\_X1**

**u1 -> BUF\_X1**

**u2 -> AND2\_X1**

Header Section - marked as RED Color

CELL Section where we are talking about interconnect Delays - marked as GREEN color

CELL Section with respect to Flipflops - marked as BLUE color

CELL Section with respect to Buffer - marked as BLACK color

CELL Section with respect to AND gate - marked as LIGHT GREEN color.

And that's all the construct.

**Note:**

- In the Interconnect Delay, SDF has delays of all 10 wires/interconnects.

 - Input port to Reg input D pin (in1 to r1/D , in2 to r2/D)
 - Clock\_source to Clock\_input pin of Register (clk1 to r1/CK, clk2 to r2/CK, clk3 to r3/CK)
 - Reg output Q pin to Output port (r3/Q to out)
 - All internal combinational nets

- For all flipflop we have all required info which we need from .Lib

 - Clock to Q delay
 - Setup and Hold constraint
 - Positive Edge or Negative Edge triggered Flipflop
 - Clock Time period information

- For all other logic cells, we have following information

 - Cell Rising and Falling delay
 - Cell - Min, Max and Typical Delay
 - Input pin - output pin specific delay (also know as ARC delay - like in case of AND - a->y and b-y)

### [How To Read SDF (Standard Delay Format) - Part4](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2019/12/standard-delay-format-4.html)

In the last few articles ( [PART 1](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2011/03/how-to-read-sdf-standard-delay-format.html), [PART 2](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2011/03/how-to-read-sdf-standard-delay-format_16.html) and [PART 3](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2011/03/how-to-read-sdf-standard-delay-format_17.html)), we have discussed the following things

- What is SDF and what information it contain?
- Construct of SDF (2 Section ‚Äì Header and CELL)

 - Header Section contain general information about the Tool which is used to create/generate the SDF and the Design related information (like Design name, Process, Voltage, Temperature of the design for which SDF is generated).
 - Cell Section can be multiple in the SDF file. These CELL section can represent to a specific Primitive cell (standard Cell) or a region of the design (Blocks) or any instance in a hierarchy.
 - Cell section has 3 different sub-section ‚Äì CELLTYPE , INSTANCE, Timing specification section.
 - Timing specification section contain actual timing data associated with that cell. There are four types of timing specifications that are identified by the DELAY, TIMINGCHECK, TIMINGENV, and LABEL keywords.

 - DELAY: Specify the delay related information for back-annotation.
 - TIMINGCHECK: Specify Timing checks limit data for back-annotation
 - TIMINGENV: Specify timing environment data and constraint data for forward-annotation.
 - LABEL: Set the values of timing model variables upon that delays and timing constraint values depend

In this Article, we will discuss more details about the DELAY construct. This is the most important part of the SDF. It‚Äôs a Standard Delay format ‚Äì so it‚Äôs important to have a separate Article only for Delay.

Delay values are defined in SDF in the form of list. This list can have 1,2,3,6 or 12 pairs. These pairs are corresponds to the transition of the signal at the output port. The sequence of those transition is fixed and described in the following table.

- If only 1 pair is present in the delay list then it‚Äôs same for all 12 transition.
- There are chances that in SDF, any pair has NULL value. It is consider as placeholder for that particular transition. Means the stage where SDF is created, the delay info corresponding to that transition is not available and later it can be filled.

**Example 1: (IOPATH i3 o1 () () (2:4:5) (4:5:6) (2:4:5) (4:5:6))**

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNIIr3BQtCYz2WZpOADp9RbeQJpcNCqAwB8nMhAeU_yR65QBxH-gjsGZOOGHyt0mbYtirP2SA3rJEanRvMnRuMDvMLC1OlGWO1tO02HH7Z5ICVq9AKxFQKtJwu8h8ybsdvyw2Aryj7ZHw/s640/example_sdf.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNIIr3BQtCYz2WZpOADp9RbeQJpcNCqAwB8nMhAeU_yR65QBxH-gjsGZOOGHyt0mbYtirP2SA3rJEanRvMnRuMDvMLC1OlGWO1tO02HH7Z5ICVq9AKxFQKtJwu8h8ybsdvyw2Aryj7ZHw/s1600/example_sdf.png)

In the above example, there is no delay value present for 0->1 and 1->0 transition.

### Type of Delay:

There are 2 types of Delay based on how it will be annotated into the design.

**Incremental Delay:** If any delay value is defined under this category it means it will add SDF value into the Delay present in the design (at the time you are trying to annotate SDF delay).

**Absolute Delay:** If any delay value is defined under this category it means it will replace the Delay present in the design (at the time you are trying to annotate SDF delay).

### Category of Delay in SDF:

Delay in the SDF can be any of the following category.

**1) Input-output path Delay:**

- Represent the delays on a legal path from an input/bidirectional port to an output/bidirectional port of a device. Each delay value shall be associated with a unique input\_port - output\_port pair.
- Input or a bidirectional port can have an edge identifier.
- No edge Identifier can be present in case of output or a bidirectional port.
- Representation of Delay values are in the same fashion as explained in above.
- Construct used in SDF : IOPATH

**Note:**

- For in1, positive edge identifier is specified.
- These Delay are absolute (ABSOLUTE) in nature. Means it‚Äôs going to replace any delay specified in Timing models for these paths under specified transitions.
- For in3, delay values are NULL for first 2 transition (0->1 and 1->0). It means for these transition, Delay values are unchanged (it will remain as-it-is as in the timing models).

**2) Conditional path delays:**

Now if you want to apply a particular condition before applying a particular path delay, we can use this method. The conditional path delay shall specify conditional (state-dependent) input-to-output path delays.

There are 2 ways to apply the conditions

- If a Particular Condition met, then apply the Delay value

 - The annotator must locate in the timing model a path delay with conditions matching those specified in the SDF file. Other path delays between the same ports but with different conditions shall not receive the data.
 - The expression shall evaluate to a logical signal, rather than a boolean. The analysis tool shall treat a logical zero as FALSE and any other logical value (1, X, or Z) as TRUE. A particular conditional path delay in the timing model shall be used only if the condition is TRUE.
 - Use the SDF Construct : COND

- If a Particular Condition doesn‚Äôt met, then apply the Delay value

 - The delay values specified in SDF shall be used if none of the conditions specified for the path in the model are TRUE but a signal must still be propagated over the path.
 - Use the SDF construct: CONDELSE

**3) Port Delay:**

- Port delay specify the interconnect delay (actual or estimated) that are modelled as delay at input port.
- Use the SDF Construct: PORT

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzOcQINKGeSgk-TxTlPG5YfhxqzCFQWQm0vm9UBlsAeM0tJjnJfuEwX5fa-QvTjYLzGRIQbgwcRXoAah5fQimGroJeN2Ipshg4HQHv7qOx-b5_0UnFRRQQ8M-zGliOVCUahauDgZ90kOE/s640/portdelay-sdf.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzOcQINKGeSgk-TxTlPG5YfhxqzCFQWQm0vm9UBlsAeM0tJjnJfuEwX5fa-QvTjYLzGRIQbgwcRXoAah5fQimGroJeN2Ipshg4HQHv7qOx-b5_0UnFRRQQ8M-zGliOVCUahauDgZ90kOE/s1600/portdelay-sdf.PNG)

**Note:** Above delay is applied same for net between ‚Äúy‚Äù and ‚Äúc.r1.a‚Äù and ‚Äúc.r2.a‚Äù.

**4) Interconnect Delay**

- The interconnect delay shall specify the propagation delay across a net connecting a driving module port (the source) to a driven module port (the load).
- Either or both ports can be bidirectional. Both source and load ports for the delay path shall be specified.
- Use the SDF Construct: INTERCONNECT

**5) Net Delay:**

- The net delays shall specify the propagation delays from all sources to all loads of a net.
- Neither start nor end points for the delay path are specified, and the delays from all the source ports to all the destination ports will have the same value.
- Use the SDF Construct: NETDELAY

There are other SDF construct also but I am not discussing them here. The reason being ‚Äì it will increase the length of the Article & looks to me that‚Äôs not required right now.;) For the detail info, you can refer the ‚ÄúIEEE standard for Standard Delay format for electronic design format‚Äù. Most of my content also have same reference.

Apart of this ‚Äì Most important thing is SDF constructs are originally targeted for annotation to tools using the Verilog language, so many SDF constructs are analogous to those in Verilog specify blocks. Those already familiar with the Verilog specify block will find many of the SDF constructs familiar. So it‚Äôs very easy for those who are champ in Verilog. ÔÅä

In the Next Article, we will take a circuit and respective SDF, to give you an idea - how to read SDF with respect to a circuit.

### [Single VIA, VIA array, Stacked VIA](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/12/vias.html)

A via forms a connection between overlapping geometries on different layers through a cut layer, and is formed by geometries on all three layers.

Three types of vias:

1. a single via,
2. an array via,
3. and a stacked via.

### 1) Single VIA

Below diagram help you to understand how single VIA are placed between 2 metal and help them to connect them.

Figure 3D\_b is a transparent view of the 3D\_a. It helps you to understand how different layers are connected with each other.

**Side View of Via and Metal connection.**

There are certain Design rules for VIAs also. I am not going to capture those in detail here but below figure give you a general idea.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFOHwmucFbjkVaNavgHns1ThaeI7NmDd_QBvpsiCRt5m9vwToIwRBzp834Mf80HZY0PoVBcwcZa_5ZrtHZG2i3JFq7tLAxty5skWErPdukOHqgrWfv9MG8z6OOCXq5pfj59Qqe8lWI7No/s400/via_design_rules.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFOHwmucFbjkVaNavgHns1ThaeI7NmDd_QBvpsiCRt5m9vwToIwRBzp834Mf80HZY0PoVBcwcZa_5ZrtHZG2i3JFq7tLAxty5skWErPdukOHqgrWfv9MG8z6OOCXq5pfj59Qqe8lWI7No/s1600/via_design_rules.PNG)

Vias can be asymmetric, meaning the overhangs in the x and y directions are different. The overhang parameters refer to those of a via connecting preferred-direction wires. If the wires are in the nonpreferred direction, the via is rotated and the overhangs are reversed, meaning that the extensions in the x direction are given by the y overhang parameters.

### 2) VIA Array

Array vias are used for connecting wide wires where the required cut size would exceed the maximum cut size of the simple via. In an array via, the region of intersection of the wires is filled by a regular array of small cuts of fixed size and separation.

Figure 3D\_b is a transparent view of the 3D\_a. It helps you to understand how different layers are connected with each other. you can also see that array size is 3x1 between M1 and M2. When it comes to M2 and M3, Single VIA connects both the wire. But dnt think that it will always be the case. It depends on design that and width of Metal wire, if you want to use VIA array or Single VIA. In the below figure, you can see that M1 and M2 are using 3x3 VIA array. Between M2 and M3 - it's 1x3 VIA array.

2D view of Stack via is not easy to understand. But if you want to try, you can do it in any tool to understand properly.

**I can summarize this article with combined view of all 3 type of VIAs.**

### [Metal Wire Orientation (HVH or VHV)](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/11/metal-wire-orientation.html)

In [previous articles](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/10/metal-layer-stack-nomenclature-part-2.html), we have discussed a lot about type of metal wire like Mx, My and others. We have also discussed about the Metal stack like 6 Metal layer stack : M1\_3Mx\_My\_Mz. (If you have confusion, please refer Article " [Metal Layer Stack Nomenclature](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/10/metal-layer-stack-nomenclature-part-2.html)").

In this article, we are going to understand another important concept: "Metal layer Orientation". Actually during routing of design, we use a terminology "Preferred Routing Direction" of Metal layer. May be you have heard HVH or VHV routing strategy. Even if not - then I am sure you have seen below fig somewhere :) .

In the above pic, you can see that M1, M3 & M5 are in Horizontal direction and M2 & M4 are in vertical direction. Still confused ??? :) Let me help you.

Metal wires in our design are at different levels. If, I assume that M1 is at first level then M2 is at second level, M3 at third and so on. Type of Metal (Mx, My, Mz) depends as per Metal Stack you are going to choose for your design. (For more detailing about the Metal stack - please refer Article " [Metal Layer Stack](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/10/metal-layer-stack-metallization-option1.html)"). By now, you should be clear that different metals present at different height with respect to substrate.

Now, only one question is remaining, how we are going to route these metals? How in the sense - in which direction or say orientation. Is/are there any standard/s behind this or user can route these metals wires as per their requirement? Very short answer of this question - There are standards or say recommendation for routing Metal wires. Timing is very critical now a days. From metal wires point of view - capacitance between them plays a very important role. ( **Note:** Delay has relationship with RC constant - and this C is because of Capacitance between the wires). So as a designer we have to understand or say use those technique which can minimize these unwanted Capacitance (Remember - capacitance between Wires are always unwanted. It's always has side effect in negative sense :) ). To understand different type of capacitance between wires, you can refer Article " [Basic of Capacitance & Resistance (from VLSI Point of view)](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2012/02/parasitic-interconnect-corner-rc-corner.html)"

Capacitance between 2 plates depends on area of plates parallel to each other OR I can say overlap area between 2 metal wires. During Routing - there are 2 extreme routing methodology.

1. Parallel Routing Grid
2. Cross Routing Grid

If we place metal wire on these routing grids (as an example - just picked only 2 wires of same metal layer), you can easily understand the concept of overlap area. Remember, right now we are talking about Ground cap (or Area cap) and not Coupling cap.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiysZ-Sy7EpArsS2qh404v6ICaIbG_UVofWhDWJM21ga8mRMYM7-a3yWTxPvKOAwDl3iBDc_qRVEa9LpHjRdnMyAZea4GlUY1CUHc1G1Vz1T5JpSnTTcdwKOQfJsxECNjHfi-uvkQXXttY/s640/Metal_wire_orientation.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiysZ-Sy7EpArsS2qh404v6ICaIbG_UVofWhDWJM21ga8mRMYM7-a3yWTxPvKOAwDl3iBDc_qRVEa9LpHjRdnMyAZea4GlUY1CUHc1G1Vz1T5JpSnTTcdwKOQfJsxECNjHfi-uvkQXXttY/s1600/Metal_wire_orientation.PNG)

**Parallel Metal Wire Orientation:**

In the below figure, I have tried to show arrangement of capacitance between parallel metal wire between metal layers of different levels Like capacitance between M1 and M2. Since M1 and M2 both are parallel to each other 100%, Capacitance between them has dependency on width and length of the wire. This arrangement gives maximum Ground cap (Area cap).

**Note**: We are not discussing the capacitance between same type of metal layers (Between M1 and M1) known as Coupling Capacitance.

**Cross / Perpendicular Metal Wire Orientation:**

In the below figure, you can see that overlap area between M1 and M2 is only at their cross-section. This overlap area depends on their corresponding width parameter. You can see that their is no dependency on length of the wire. This arrangement gives minimum Ground cap (Area cap).

Front view and Side view of this arrangement helps you to understand this routing methodology more closely.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHdT0XOyoN8I9WjeiTtvmxtbXfEl9Q5dDm-NDKrakxkJiqDGRgBgc0HVnAiALt7OcmwE45V72ZXAEtKhtlUWDCWGoxvlkVPm3v0FdAeDocIgMDr05UZ6qYT8afrdtDmf3wNqIYo_u3QIU/s640/Cross+Wire+Orientation.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHdT0XOyoN8I9WjeiTtvmxtbXfEl9Q5dDm-NDKrakxkJiqDGRgBgc0HVnAiALt7OcmwE45V72ZXAEtKhtlUWDCWGoxvlkVPm3v0FdAeDocIgMDr05UZ6qYT8afrdtDmf3wNqIYo_u3QIU/s1600/Cross+Wire+Orientation.PNG)

You can see that if we want to reduce the CAP then orientation of the Metal wire is very important. Cross (perpendicular) metal wire orientation gives minimum capacitance and that's the reason it's recommended. One of the direction is considered as Horizontal and other as Vertical. That's the reason - these orientation is known as HVH or VHV orientation (and corresponding routing strategy as HVH or VHV routing methods).

### [Delay Interview Questions (Part 2)](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/11/delay-interview-questions-part2.html)

In the last part ( [Delay Interview Questions: Part 1](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/10/delay-interview-question-part1.html)), we have discusses 2 scenarios

1. Min & Max Delay Between 2 points having multi-paths when Delay are given as absolute number.
2. Min & Max Delay between 2 points having multi-paths when Delay are given as Rise and Fall delay.

We have discussed these concepts from Interview point of view.

**Note:** [Example 1](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/10/delay-interview-question-part1.html#example1) and [Example 2](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/10/delay-interview-question-part1.html#example2), we have already discussed in last article.

### Example 3:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVuGfKUXGZmZT0FgMHbEHnoe6oDjxfGVznDBewTBd-v6weVfkoU83cr1DQDbViW9KcyveVBqqxHd-mOOWWlLhBsX2Kd8nmvyiEWLlCYC__4iV0AP4WWsx40nxWZzQGiwLam4iJCyBvxbQ/s640/Delay+3.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVuGfKUXGZmZT0FgMHbEHnoe6oDjxfGVznDBewTBd-v6weVfkoU83cr1DQDbViW9KcyveVBqqxHd-mOOWWlLhBsX2Kd8nmvyiEWLlCYC__4iV0AP4WWsx40nxWZzQGiwLam4iJCyBvxbQ/s1600/Delay+3.PNG)

**Note:** Above figure is same as in Example 1 and Example 2 (with small addition).

All Buffer has same (min, max) delay = (0.1ns, 0.2ns)

All NOT Gate has same (min, max) delay = (0.25ns, 1ns)

AND gate (min, max) delay:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Arc a1 -> y1 = (1.25ns, 1.5ns)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Arc b1 -> y1 = (1.1ns, 1.9ns)

OR gate (min, max) delay:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Arc a2 -> y2 = (0.3ns, 0.4ns)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Arc b2 -> y2 = (0.5ns, 0.9ns)

**Question: Find out the Minimum and Maximum Delay between Q1 and D2?**

**Explanation:**

This question is almost equal to the example 1 but with slight modification. Now, we are talking about the different input and output combination of AND gate. Remember, every input and output combination has it's own delay value. When we talk about the Delay of a Gate and if it's not related to input and output combination, it means we are talking about Boundaries of overall gate delay. To understand this concept - you need to revise or say understand Timing Arc concepts. Please read article [Timing Arc](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2016/09/timing-arc.html) and [Unate: Timing Arc](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2016/12/unate-timing-arc.html).

Intension of this question is to get more accurate delay value based on Path base analysis.

**Note:** Delay calculation in such circuit are of 2 type - Path base Analysis and Graph Base Analysis. You can get more detail about this in Article - [Path Base Vs Graph Base Analysis: Part 1](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/11/pba-vs-gba-1.html).

There is a little bit change in the picture of Path 1 and Path 2 (in compare to Example 1 and Example 2).

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvTK9dviPSo7AewtaIBe2MnWYefjMSgsMcD5vaGXd_MMoRH_UADLi4zR-upeMHDy2_xvVG4uk1LjdGbyYoG0GtvxbEcEy3q6WyWgJvjBNb0tEw-SN-SU-z8L4UdE1VEm8A0jhhE-TvCKg/s640/Delay+4.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvTK9dviPSo7AewtaIBe2MnWYefjMSgsMcD5vaGXd_MMoRH_UADLi4zR-upeMHDy2_xvVG4uk1LjdGbyYoG0GtvxbEcEy3q6WyWgJvjBNb0tEw-SN-SU-z8L4UdE1VEm8A0jhhE-TvCKg/s1600/Delay+4.PNG)

In the above figure, you can see that

**Path 1: Q1 -> Inverter -> b1 -> y1 -> Buffer -> a2 -> y2 -> Buffer -> D2**

**Path 2: Q1 -> Inverter -> Inverter -> Inverter -> b2 -> y2 -> Buffer -> D2**

**In Path 1:**

b1 -> y1 is basically part of AND gate and during delay calculation we will use **delay value as per Arc b1 -> y1 = (1.1ns, 1.9ns)**.

a2 - > y2 is basically part of OR gate and **delay values are as per Arc a2 -> y2 = (0.3ns, 0.4ns)**.

**In Path 2:**

b2 - > y2 is basically part of OR gate and **delay values are as per Arc b2 -> y2 = (0.5ns, 0.9ns)**.

**Solution:**

Path 1 (Min Delay) : 0.25 (inverter) + 1.1 (b1 -> y1) + 0.1 (buffer) + 0.3 (a2 -> y2) + 0.1 (buffer) = 1.85ns

Path 1 (Max Delay) : 1.00 (inverter) + 1.9 (b1 -> y1) + 0.2 (buffer) + 0.4 (a2 -> y2) + 0.2 (buffer) = 3.70ns

Path 2 (Min Delay) : 0.25 (inverter) + 0.25 (inverter) + 0.25 (inverter) + 0.5 (b2 -> y2) + 0.1 (buffer) = 1.35ns

Path 2 (Max Delay) : 1.00 (inverter) + 1.0 (inverter) + 1.0 (inverter) + 0.9 (b2 -> y2) + 0.2 (buffer) = 4.1ns

**Overall Min Delay between Q1 and D2 = 1.35ns (From Path 2)**

**Overall Max Delay between Q1 and D2 = 4.1ns (From Path 2)**

### Example 4:

All Buffer has same delay:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tphl (min, max) = (0.1ns, 0.18ns)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tplh (min, max) = (0.15ns, 0.20ns)

All NOT Gate has same delay:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tphl (min, max) = (0.25ns, 0.75ns)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tplh (min, max) = (0.5ns, 1.0ns)

AND gate delay:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Arc a1 -> y1:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tphl (min, max) = (1.25ns, 1.5ns)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tplh (min, max) = (1.3ns, 1.75ns)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Arc b1 -> y1

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tphl (min, max) = (1.0ns, 1.9ns)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tplh (min, max) = (1.1ns, 2.0ns)

OR gate (min, max) delay:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Arc a2 -> y2:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tphl (min, max) = (0.3ns, 0.35ns)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tplh (min, max) = (0.31ns, 0.4ns)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Arc b2 -> y2:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tphl (min, max) = (0.51ns, 0.9ns)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Tplh (min, max) = (0.5ns, 0.75ns)

**Note:**

Tphl = Propagation Delay High to Low

Tplh = Propagation Delay Low to High

**Question: Find out the Tplh and Tphl at point D2 with respect to Input Q1?**

**Explanation:**

For this you need to understand the concepts of Tphl and Tplh. I am assuming that you know this part. Here we have to understand how different waveform (Rising input or Falling input) is going to behave in this circuit.

There is a little bit change in the picture of Path 1 and Path 2 (in compare to Example 1 and Example 2).

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvTK9dviPSo7AewtaIBe2MnWYefjMSgsMcD5vaGXd_MMoRH_UADLi4zR-upeMHDy2_xvVG4uk1LjdGbyYoG0GtvxbEcEy3q6WyWgJvjBNb0tEw-SN-SU-z8L4UdE1VEm8A0jhhE-TvCKg/s640/Delay+4.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvTK9dviPSo7AewtaIBe2MnWYefjMSgsMcD5vaGXd_MMoRH_UADLi4zR-upeMHDy2_xvVG4uk1LjdGbyYoG0GtvxbEcEy3q6WyWgJvjBNb0tEw-SN-SU-z8L4UdE1VEm8A0jhhE-TvCKg/s1600/Delay+4.PNG)

We have to do 2 type of analysis for each path - Rising & Falling signal analysis at D1 for both paths.

**Rising Signal Analysis (For Path1):**

- Inverter is Negative Unate -> Rising Signal at input means falling signal at output -> Means Tphl of NOT gate => (0.25ns, 0.75ns)
- AND gate is Positive Unate -> Falling signal at input means falling signal at output -> Means Tphl of AND gate for ARC b1 -> y1 => (1.0ns, 1.9ns)
- Buffer is Positive Unate -> Falling signal at input means falling signal at output -> Means Tphl of Buffer gate => (0.1ns, 0.18ns)
- OR is Positive Unate -> Falling signal at input means falling signal at output -> Means Tphl of OR gate for ARC a2 -> y2 => (0.3ns, 0.35ns)
- Buffer is Positive Unate -> Falling signal at input means falling signal at output -> Means Tphl of Buffer gate => (0.1ns, 0.18ns)

For Rising Signal at the Input (Q1), we are getting Falling Signal at the Output (D2) through Path1. So in this scenario, delay between Q1 and D1 through Path1 = **Tphl**.

Minimum Tphl at D1 through Path 1 = 0.25ns + 1.0ns + 0.1ns + 0.3ns + 0.1ns = 1.75ns

Maximum Tphl at D1 through Path 1 = 0.75ns + 1.9ns + 0.18ns + 0.35ns + 0.18ns = 3.36ns

**Falling Signal Analysis (For Path1):**

- Inverter is Negative Unate -> Falling Signal at input means rising signal at output -> Means Tplh of NOT gate => (0.5ns, 1.0ns)
- AND gate is Positive Unate -> Rising signal at input means rising signal at output -> Means Tplh of AND gate for ARC b1 -> y1 => (1.1ns, 2.0ns)
- Buffer is Positive Unate -> Rising signal at input means rising signal at output -> Means Tplh of Buffer gate => (0.15ns, 0.20ns)
- OR is Positive Unate -> Rising signal at input means rising signal at output -> Means Tplh of OR gate for ARC a2 -> y2 => (0.31ns, 0.4ns)
- Buffer is Positive Unate -> Rising signal at input means rising signal at output -> Means Tplh of Buffer gate => (0.15ns, 0.20ns)

For Falling Signal at the Input (Q1), we are getting Rising Signal at the Output (D2) through Path1. So in this scenario, delay between Q1 and D1 through Path1 = **Tplh**.

Minimum Tplh at D1 through Path 1 = 0.5ns + 1.1ns + 0.15ns + 0.31ns + 0.15ns = 2.21ns

Maximum Tplh at D1 through Path 1 = 1.0ns + 2.0ns + 0.20ns + 0.40ns + 0.20ns = 3.80ns

**Rising Signal Analysis (For Path2):**

- Inverter is Negative Unate -> Rising Signal at input means falling signal at output -> Means Tphl of NOT gate => (0.25ns, 0.75ns)
- Inverter is Negative Unate -> Falling signal at input means rising signal at output -> Means Tplh of NOT gate => (0.5ns, 1.0ns)
- Inverter is Negative Unate -> Rising signal at input means falling signal at output -> Means Tphl of NOT gate => (0.25ns, 0.75ns)
- OR is Positive Unate -> Falling signal at input means falling signal at output -> Means Tphl of OR gate for ARC b2 -> y2 => (0.51ns, 0.9ns)
- Buffer is Positive Unate -> Falling signal at input means falling signal at output -> Means Tphl of Buffer gate => (0.1ns, 0.18ns)

For Rising Signal at the Input (Q1), we are getting Falling Signal at the Output (D2) through Path2. So in this scenario, delay between Q1 and D1 through Path2 = **Tphl**.

Minimum Tphl at D1 through Path 2 = 0.25ns + 0.5ns + 0.25ns + 0.51ns + 0.10ns = 1.61ns

Maximum Tphl at D1 through Path 2 = 0.75ns + 1.0ns + 0.75ns + 0.90ns + 0.18ns = 3.58ns

**Falling Signal Analysis (For Path2):**

- Inverter is Negative Unate -> Falling Signal at input means rising signal at output -> Means Tplh of NOT gate => (0.5ns, 1.0ns)
- Inverter is Negative Unate -> Rising signal at input means falling signal at output -> Means Tphl of NOT gate => (0.25ns, 0.75ns)
- Inverter is Negative Unate -> Falling signal at input means rising signal at output -> Means Tplh of NOT gate => (0.5ns, 1.0ns)
- OR is Positive Unate -> Rising signal at input means rising signal at output -> Means Tplh of OR gate for ARC b2 -> y2 => (0.5ns, 0.75ns)
- Buffer is Positive Unate -> Rising signal at input means rising signal at output -> Means Tplh of Buffer gate => (0.15ns, 0.20ns)

For Falling Signal at the Input (Q1), we are getting Rising Signal at the Output (D2) through Path2. So in this scenario, delay between Q1 and D1 through Path2 = **Tplh**.

Minimum Tplh at D1 through Path 2 = 0.50ns + 0.25ns + 0.50ns + 0.50ns + 0.15ns = 1.90ns

Maximum Tplh at D1 through Path 2 = 1.00ns + 0.75ns + 1.00ns + 0.75ns + 0.20ns = 3.70ns

**Solution:**

Through Path 1 (Min Tplh) : 2.21ns

Through Path 1 (Min Tphl) : 1.75ns

Through Path 2 (Min Tplh) : 1.90ns

Through Path 2 (Min Tphl) : 1.61ns

Through Path 1 (Max Tplh) : 3.80ns

Through Path 1 (Max Tphl) : 3.36ns

Through Path 2 (Max Tplh) : 3.70ns

Through Path 2 (Max Tphl) : 3.58ns

**Overall Minimum Tplh** at D2 (when input is at Q1) = 1.90ns (Through Path 2)

**Overall Maximum Tplh** at D2 (when input is at Q1) = 3.80ns (Through Path 1)

**Overall Minimum Tphl** at D2 (when input is at Q1) = 1.61ns (Through Path 2)

**Overall Maximum Tphl** at D2 (when input is at Q1) = 3.58ns (Through Path 2)

In Summary, I can write, **At D2 with respect to Q1 Tphl = (1.61ns, 3.58ns) & Tplh = (1.90ns, 3.80ns)**

Is it done? I mean do you think Interviewer is going to stop at this point. :) :) Don't ever think. By now they will realize that you are good in below concepts.

- Min and Max Delay Calculation
- Delay calculation based on Timing Arc (I can say some part of Path base & Graph base analysis)
- Tphl and Tplh based Delay Calculation
- Multipath Delay Calculation
- Use of Rising edge and Falling Edge at Input during delay calculation

Now, it's time to check few more concepts related to CELL Delay (Like Cell Delay as a function of Input Transition Vs Output Load) and then how you can use those concepts in delay calculation of Combinational Circuit. :) Lets discuss this in Next Article.

### [Path Base Analysis (PBA) Vs Graph Base Analysis (GBA) - part1](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/11/pba-vs-gba-1.html)

Today, we are going to discuss about the Path base analysis Vs Graph base analysis. As such difference is more complex compare to what I am going to explain, but right now it's sufficient to start with. :)

Let's you have a combinational path with Net delay (min, max) and Cell delay (As per the Timing Arc). If, you have any confusion with respect to the timing arc, please refer below articles.

- [Introduction of Timing Arc](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2016/09/timing-arc.html)
- [Unateness](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2016/12/unate-timing-arc.html)

In the below figure, you can see AND gate (1) has 2 input, so 2 set of input-output delay combination.

- Min Delay = 0.5ns, Max Delay = 1.5ns
- Min Delay = 0.2ns, Max Delay = 1.2ns

Similarly, for other logic gates.

Now, if I will ask you to calculate the delay between point A and point B, then the concept of PBA and GBA comes into the picture. Before, I explain you this concept, please refer below few figures and then see the difference between PBA and GBA.

I am sure, if you have notice closely, then you have already realized the difference. :) But still let me highlight that.

In **GBA (Graph Base Analysis)**, in place of choosing 2 combinations of AND gate (1) delay, i.e. (Combination\_1: 0.5ns, 1.5ns ; Combination\_2: 0.2ns, 1.2ns) we choose extreme boundaries, i.e. **min delay = 0.2ns and max delay = 1.5ns.**

In case of **PBA (Path base Analysis)**, we are using actual delay between input pin and output combination (means choosing both combination of delay).

- Combination\_1: 0.5ns, 1.5ns
- Combination\_2: 0.2ns, 1.2ns

**Note:** Check the similar difference for AND gate (2) also.

You might be thinking that this is not accurate (means why in GBA we missed 2 value), we are adding unnecessary delay in our calculation. And I am glad to say that you are right. :) The reason we are doing this because from tool point of view - doing analysis or say calculation as per GBA is very fast compare to PBA. **Runtime of tool is very low.** And only difference is that we are adding pessimism in our calculation.

Now, if you want to understand the calculation of delay between different input pin (A, B, C) and Output Pin (Y), please check below figures.

**Note:** For clarity purpose (used different color combination) - I did this calculation and pasting in the form of picture. :)

**Important observation, which you all should noticed:**

**Delay between A and Y**

Graph base analysis (Min, Max) : 7.25ns, 10.35ns

Path base analysis (Min, Max) : 7.55ns, 10.10ns

You can see that delay between A and Y - in case of GBA is superset of PBA.

Means:

**min\_delay\_in\_GBA < min\_delay\_in\_PBA**

**max\_delay\_in\_GBA > max\_delay\_in\_PBA**

**Delay between B and Y**

Graph base analysis (Min, Max) : 7.75ns, 10.85ns

Path base analysis (Min, Max) : 7.75ns, 10.30ns

You can see that delay between B and Y - in case of GBA is superset of PBA.

Means:

**min\_delay\_in\_GBA = min\_delay\_in\_PBA**

**max\_delay\_in\_GBA > max\_delay\_in\_PBA**

**Delay between C and Y**

Graph base analysis (Min, Max) : 7.05ns, 9.05ns

Path base analysis (Min, Max) : 7.25ns, 9.05ns

You can see that delay between A and Y - in case of GBA is superset of PBA.

Means:

**min\_delay\_in\_GBA < min\_delay\_in\_PBA**

**max\_delay\_in\_GBA = max\_delay\_in\_PBA**

**Let me summarize whole concept:**

> **min\_delay\_in\_GBA <= min\_delay\_in\_PBA**
>
> **max\_delay\_in\_GBA >= max\_delay\_in\_PBA**

Now, everything is good but still you may have confusion or question - why GBA? Because from above calculation, it's not clear how it's going to save Analysis Time of a Tool. How it's beneficial for Industry? If you have all these questions, no need to worry, I will explain but not in this article. I will do that next time. But I can give you hint, so that you can think about this once.

Hint:

1) Check how these minimum and maximum delays are calculated?

2) Adding Pessimism is not an problem, it's just margin in your delay calculation. How adding margin can help us?

3) What all different environment or other factors or parameters you have to consider while calculating Delay based on different timing Arc of a gate?

I think, for now, these hints are good enough. Comment here - if you know the Answer of this, else wait for next related article. :)

BEST OF LUCK.

### [Technology File: Modelling of Dielectric Layer](https://www.vlsi-expert.com/2017/10/technology-file-modelling-of-dielectric.html)

### Background of Types of Dielectric layer

Dielectric layers are of 2 types.

1. Planar Dielectric
2. Conformal Dielectric

**Note:** We have already discussed about the [conformal dielectric](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2010/09/conformal-dielectric.html) in detail. You can review once again ( [Click here](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2010/09/conformal-dielectric.html)).

Below figures can help you to refresh your memories about Planar and Conformal dielectric.

**Planar Dielectric:**

All Dielectric in the below figure (D1 to D7) are Planar dielectric.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0VExEb1vUHLwMWpxTPF7xRck2VN13JirFOXF596ENZQhm7kstZvou-A8Le8PPfEMaSH0WRVFbkTCB45IFON81LadTaIEcId1jkt1e-s2WZ7aSFRf4uiOqgbERTXzffp8QQ5il-sWoRhc/s400/planar+dielectric.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0VExEb1vUHLwMWpxTPF7xRck2VN13JirFOXF596ENZQhm7kstZvou-A8Le8PPfEMaSH0WRVFbkTCB45IFON81LadTaIEcId1jkt1e-s2WZ7aSFRf4uiOqgbERTXzffp8QQ5il-sWoRhc/s1600/planar+dielectric.PNG)

**Conformal Dielectric:**

Different type of Conformal dielectric structures are shown in below figure. There are certain parameters which helps to identify any conformal dielectric like Side thickness, Bottom thickness or Top thickness.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjCs1lvEC1gCR-G-QOFQLDnxBVTQR_Hx7q468EBPlmwdfmpVJ5nxhoa24oDw0mNsIbhYen_IkUXaRTq_sZ4iQre16opocyZ2vND_Eml-LqX4HEGXtFIHjcn5VKFTPLiM8elGFGowCwt0M/s640/conformal_dielectric.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjCs1lvEC1gCR-G-QOFQLDnxBVTQR_Hx7q468EBPlmwdfmpVJ5nxhoa24oDw0mNsIbhYen_IkUXaRTq_sZ4iQre16opocyZ2vND_Eml-LqX4HEGXtFIHjcn5VKFTPLiM8elGFGowCwt0M/s1600/conformal_dielectric.PNG)

### Modelling of Dielectric in Technology File

Modelling of Dielectric layer in technology file vary as per extraction software or you can say that as per EDA vendor. Different EDA vendor uses different ways to represents this as per their requirement. Even if I know their syntax, I can't write here. :) But what I am going to do - explain everything in more easy language. :) Once you start working, you can check their manual and try to map my syntax with their syntax. :)

To represent a **Planar Dielectric** (Non-Conformal) we need to have following basic information.

( **Parameter Name : my\_nomenclature**)

**Dielectric constant** : di\_constant

**Thickness** : thickness

**Height from the Substrate** : height

**Name of Dielectric** : DIELECTRIC

**Type of Dielectric** : conformal=false

To represent a **Conformal Dielectric** we need to have following extra information.

( **Parameter Name : my\_nomenclature**)

**Side Thickness** : S\_thickness

**Bottom Thickness** : B\_thickness

**Top Thickness** : T\_thickness

**Type of Dielectric** : conformal=true

**Parent Layer** : p\_layer (This is the layer around which dielectric is present. It can be a conductor like Poly, Metal1 or may be any other Dielectric also. In above figure, M1 is the Parent layer).

**Planar Dielectric**

Modelling in Technology file:

**DIELECTRIC DEL2**

di\_constant = 4.8

thickness = 2.7

height = 4.1

conformal = false

**DIELECTRIC DEL3**

di\_constant = 2.8

thickness = 0.3

height = 6.8

conformal = false

**Conformal Dielectric**

There are different scenarios which need to understand. These scenarios are same as we have discussed in the article of [Conformal Dielectric](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2010/09/conformal-dielectric.html)(It will help you to map easily)

### Scenario 1:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEguKZ8EL27yzqdjfSHKG6dnV269lpDXY3rjkWWn02nfv2_3n-MvI_nJQASsULAWTOJR3EyNfExcuRjAXcms97ymBCsScDKChOOKIfNyrnn6SDcwGSvGAQ3IURsgGkJOOc0dYtVe3M-jSOU/s640/Conformal+Dielectric+1.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEguKZ8EL27yzqdjfSHKG6dnV269lpDXY3rjkWWn02nfv2_3n-MvI_nJQASsULAWTOJR3EyNfExcuRjAXcms97ymBCsScDKChOOKIfNyrnn6SDcwGSvGAQ3IURsgGkJOOc0dYtVe3M-jSOU/s1600/Conformal+Dielectric+1.PNG)

Modelling in Technology file:

**DIELECTRIC DEL\_M1a**

conformal = true

T\_thickness = 0.2

S\_thickness = 0.2

B\_thickness = 0

di\_constant = 3.8

thickness = 0

height = 4.1

p\_layer = M1

**DIELECTRIC DEL\_M1b**

conformal = true

T\_thickness = 0

S\_thickness = 0.2

B\_thickness = 0.2

di\_constant = 3.8

thickness = 0

height = 4.1

p\_layer = M1

### Scenario 2:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1OGc0GccvpxYwvkU5o2oVYPBp45ZcnE__4KDO3WxKmQZIJct3IcmOJR34R0pYXbzDoOY6kA287-cplKA2pY-qEfnoOVDAkZOWwhMEoW2FXwduWt-bNafx5Hot6QnmRr5wRX6pyoeBiU8/s640/Conformal+Dielectric+2.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1OGc0GccvpxYwvkU5o2oVYPBp45ZcnE__4KDO3WxKmQZIJct3IcmOJR34R0pYXbzDoOY6kA287-cplKA2pY-qEfnoOVDAkZOWwhMEoW2FXwduWt-bNafx5Hot6QnmRr5wRX6pyoeBiU8/s1600/Conformal+Dielectric+2.PNG)

Modelling in Technology file:

**DIELECTRIC DEL\_a**

conformal = true

T\_thickness = 0.2

S\_thickness = 0

B\_thickness = 0

di\_constant = 3.8

thickness = 0

height = 4.1

p\_layer = M1

**DIELECTRIC DEL\_b**

conformal = true

T\_thickness = 0

S\_thickness = 0.2

B\_thickness = 0

di\_constant = 3.8

thickness = 0

height = 4.1

p\_layer = M1

**DIELECTRIC DEL\_c**

conformal = true

T\_thickness = 0

S\_thickness = 0

B\_thickness = 0.2

di\_constant = 3.8

thickness = 0

height = 4.1

p\_layer = M1

### Scenario 3:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWXaH3BH7-nJaLzqE0ulJI3fw2QNFV15EmnWI3I1gK4NKoDSdmapaWVVLkKyrEKUqFfJlM2hYpXTnMFSjdjX989STHcnVIv8CqbKBuH1Gw2f26IXtMSIX_z9cDNACDwYFCUTrYfxcmecI/s640/Conformal+Dielectric+3.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWXaH3BH7-nJaLzqE0ulJI3fw2QNFV15EmnWI3I1gK4NKoDSdmapaWVVLkKyrEKUqFfJlM2hYpXTnMFSjdjX989STHcnVIv8CqbKBuH1Gw2f26IXtMSIX_z9cDNACDwYFCUTrYfxcmecI/s1600/Conformal+Dielectric+3.PNG)

Representation of DEL\_a1, DEL\_a2 and DEL\_a3 in Technology file:

**DIELECTRIC DEL\_a1**

conformal = true

T\_thickness = 0.2

S\_thickness = 0

B\_thickness = 0

di\_constant = 3.8

thickness = 0

height = 4.1

p\_layer = M1

**DIELECTRIC DEL\_a2**

conformal = true

T\_thickness = 0.15

S\_thickness = 0

B\_thickness = 0

di\_constant = 2.8

thickness = 0

height = 4.1

p\_layer = DEL\_a1

**DIELECTRIC DEL\_a3**

conformal = true

T\_thickness = 0.15

S\_thickness = 0

B\_thickness = 0

di\_constant = 1.8

thickness = 0

height = 4.1

p\_layer = DEL\_a2

**Remember:** In above representation, for DEL\_a2, p\_layer is previous dielectric (i.e DEL\_a1). It's because this dielectric has parent layer DEL\_a1. It's deposited on the top of DEL\_a1. Top thickness also measured with respect to DEL\_a1.

Note: you might be thinking why Height parameter is same in all 3 cases. It depends on EDA vendor, how they want to represent the height of Conformal layer. Here I am assuming that my tool is going to automatically measure actual height with the help of provided data. :)

Representation of DEL\_b1 and DEL\_b2 in Technology file:

**DIELECTRIC DEL\_b1**

conformal = true

T\_thickness = 0

S\_thickness = 0.2

B\_thickness = 0

di\_constant = 3.8

thickness = 0

height = 4.1

p\_layer = M1

**DIELECTRIC DEL\_b2**

conformal = true

T\_thickness = 0

S\_thickness = 0.15

B\_thickness = 0

di\_constant = 2.8

thickness = 0

height = 4.1

p\_layer = DEL\_b1

Similarly, Representation of DEL\_c1 and DEL\_c2 in Technology file:

**DIELECTRIC DEL\_c1**

conformal = true

T\_thickness = 0

S\_thickness = 0

B\_thickness = 0.2

di\_constant = 3.8

thickness = 0

height = 4.1

p\_layer = M1

**DIELECTRIC DEL\_c2**

conformal = true

T\_thickness = 0

S\_thickness = 0

B\_thickness = 0.15

di\_constant = 2.8

thickness = 0

height = 4.1

p\_layer = DEL\_c1

### Scenario 4:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXM1OhoeYNX5hBoUGNztx8kR4fvvKNgbWchsnDLnpOobSnMfj98ph-ir-U-D7oTt8mFV_BpEqXFiKYheUSST7W-vekMlxCwjzdNpdNb_CWjailss2QkpmpXSiojhzQvxLjpy2mAFPZSTc/s640/conformal_dielectric1.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXM1OhoeYNX5hBoUGNztx8kR4fvvKNgbWchsnDLnpOobSnMfj98ph-ir-U-D7oTt8mFV_BpEqXFiKYheUSST7W-vekMlxCwjzdNpdNb_CWjailss2QkpmpXSiojhzQvxLjpy2mAFPZSTc/s1600/conformal_dielectric1.PNG)

Modelling in Technology file:

**DIELECTRIC DEL2**

conformal = true

**T\_thickness = 0.1**

S\_thickness = 0.2

B\_thickness = 0.0

di\_constant = 2.8

**thickness = 0.4**

height = 4.1

p\_layer = M1

DEL2 is a conformal dielectric & the reason behind this is - It has a Side Thickness and Top thickness parameter. But you may be thinking that it looks like a planar at all other places, it's shape is similar to non-conformal dielectric. I can understand your confusion. Actually, you are right that at certain places it's conformal and at some places it's non-conformal.

In the representation of all conformal layer, you may have noticed that thickness parameter is 0. It's because they dnt have any thickness as such (I am not talking about top thickness. That's a different parameter). In this case, this thickness parameter is non-zero like in case of Planar dielectric.

At the end, I just wanted to highlight once again that different EDA vendors have different syntax and different way to represent dielectric layers in technology file. Above representation is just for your understanding purpose, it's not specific to any company.

 Hi, Sir,

 when will RC delay (wire delay) > cell delay?

 If a chip has hold violations it can be fixed by changing the supply voltage. For hold you might need to increase the logic delay and so decreasing the supply voltage. This might actually trigger set up violation but care needs to be taken.

 Hi,

 You have said, "hold violation happens when data is too fast compared to clock speed". But how can hold violation be related to clock speed? Here with clock speed do you mean delay in capture path or clock frequency?

 Thanks for the blog post . Quick query : Hold time of a flop dictates that logic delay of the combinational path be more than a given value ( Tdelay > Thold ) . So can we say that Thold puts a limit on the max frequency of operation since 1/ (max freq) > Tsetup + Tdelay ( I am ignoring c2q delays and clk skews for simplicity )

 Hi, thanks for the reply.. I read through the blogs; still I think there is a dependence ie If I reduce the combinational path delay to a very low value (~0) then there would be hold violation; hence "max freq period" = Tsetup + Tcombdelay.

 If there is a long wire between cells then adding buffers will reduces the delay through decrease in transition time. So, my question is, how is optimum number of buffers are determined? I hope adding in more numbers will increase delay than reducing it!!

 You are right .. If you will add more buffer , it will increase the delay. There are lot of ways to find the optimum number of buffers. Basically there are algorithm for that. but this post is just to provide a insight about the methods which can help you in the field or during design.

 Other Algorithm I will try to cover in some other post.

 Hi,

 I am using Vivado design suite from Xilinx. After synthesis, in timing summary, I got a some setup time violations. There was an option to maximize the delay from start point to end point. After following that step, the setup time violation issue was solved.

 The above condition contradicts the fact that "decreasing the delay" fixes the setup time violation. Please explain.

 So stage delay (cell delay + wire delay) in case of single buffer < stage delay in case of 2 inverter in the same path. I think here stage delay of buffer is > stage delay of 2inverters...also can you please explain why transition time of inverter is low..thank you

 It looks like all the methods described here are for fixing setup and hold violations during the backend stage (placement and routing) of the design. Methods like buffering in a path, inserting repeaters, HVT swap, driver size adjustment, cell position adjustment all comes in backend only. What are the possible solutions to setup and hold violations in early stage of the design, say during RTL design?

 if the supply voltage reduces delay will increase and hold violation clear.

 so why we can dump chip after fabrication??

 nice explanation.

 I have a question though, when we calculate the total delay of the path we addup cell delay + interconnect delay and cell delay is calculated by taking into account the interconnect loading effect.So, isn't this wrong as we are taking the interconnect effect twice in our delay calculation

 Hi Shubham,

 Its not like that .. we take care about the every reasons/cause of the delay with in a particular path. But we never do anything twice.If you can wait for sometime .. you will see in my few next blog, how we usually calculate the cell delay. Just give me some more time. If its urgent .. please drop me a mail.. I will try to explain you there..

 Sir,

 As u told we consider characteristics of Driver and load while calculating interconnect delay....but that is already consider in our cell delay....so it counts twice in delay calculation

 Hi ... I am talking about the characteristics .. It can be considered several time. we are not using the delay values twice.

 Think that you are traveling by a bus - you bus is not in a good condition - so you will feel tired after journey. So in case you have to visit somewhere - it matters how is your Bus condition. Means characteristic of BUS IMPACT a lot.

 Since Bus is not in a good condition - it is also sure that it will also take more time to reach destination. But that in above case we are not talking about that time taken by BUS (means delay added by BUS in your visit).

 Hope it helps you.

 While calculating the cell delays we consider the loading effect of interconnect on the cells. Then we calculate the delays through the nets as well. Arn't we adding the delays of the interconnects twice,

 Its like you read my mind! You seem to know so much about this, like you wrote the book in it or something.

 I think that you could do with a few pics to drive the message home

 a little bit, but other than that, this is wonderful blog.

 should not the launch edge be the second rising edge of CLK, since hold checks are done for the same clock cycle?

 dear clock checks ideally should be done at the rising or capturing edge of clock b only.. but sir has written and shown in the diagram that the data is arriving at the ff2 d before the clock b and it is in the transition region..which is a hold violation and we l loose data.. at the end sir has written that to avoid it.. either decrease the buffers in the clock path or increase the delay in the data so that the data arrives at or before the capturing edge of the clock b.. just to show the hold violation sir has made the same in the diagram

 Clock edge at Launching FF - considered as launching edge but when this edge reaches capturing FF, it become Capturing Edge.

 Now in setup and hold we are talking every thing on the Capturing FF, means every thing is related to Capturing edge.

 I hope you got my point. Still If some confusion, please write in detail about your confusion.

 Hi VLSI Expert,

 You have mentioned that we need to reduce the delay of the clock to avoid the hold time violation right. Could you please clarify me if you are talking about reducing the CLKB clock width?

 In the Hold Check Timing diagram, it looks like the first transition of FF2/D (1 > 0) happens at about the same time as the first rising edge of CLKB.

 So this will result in setup violation (and maybe hold violation too), even before we get to the second rising edge of CLKB.

 Can you please elaborate why setup check at next clock edge and hold check at same clock edge ?

 from CLK1 .. We check both at next clock edge and calculate also like that but why we say diffrently?

 Data can arrive at the following flip flop only at the next clock edge. At T1, FF1 generated its output to data D1, whereas FF2 was processing FF1's output to data D0. FF2 will be able to process FF1's output to D1 only at the next clock edge, T2 = T1 + T(clk).

 Hold analysis is done only after the data has already arrived, and so naturally for the same clock cycle.

 As for the figures posted above, I think the one for Hold Time is perhaps erroneous, since T(launch) and T(capture) must be at the same clock cycle. I've already posted a comment below, highlighting the same. Awaiting yourVLSI's reply!

 In the Hold Time diagram, the Capture edge has been shown one clock cycle after Launch edge, whereas it should be at the same clock edge (delayed by buffers).

 The Set-up Time diagram, too uses the same clock edges, which though, is correct.

 For the same data Capture and launch edges are always one clock cycle. But for analysis purpose of Hold - you analysis the whole concept at the same edge. I would say - check the pic more closely and you will crack this figure also.

 Hi,

 I am a silent follower of your blog. You are doing a phenomenal service to millions of people through your high caliber VLSI knowledge. If I may request you to write on the following topics, I would be grateful to you,

 1\. Setup/hold calculation of Multicycle path

 a. slow to fast clock path

 b. fast to slow clock path

 Thanks a lot!

 At Hold Check Timing Capture Edge (Rising Edge) of CLKB should to capture the correct value of FF2.D (zero) according to the current figure. There seems to be something wrong with this part of the figure??

 This figure ... is trying to help you to visualize the reason of the hold Violation.

 If my chip has a hold violation, can i resolve it by dropping the voltage? I sacrifice frequency potentially, but the delays usually increase with lower voltage?

 hey have a doubt as we know for flipflop we check the setup at next clock edge and for hold time at same clock edge.

 I want to know for latch where will be the setup and hold is checked ( i mean which clock edge )

 Latch means level-triggered (say 0 level--> 1 level ==> pos-level; 1 level-->0 level==>neg-level);

 here the setup check done before the level 1 appears

 and the setup check done before the level 1 appears

 above mentioned for pos-level

 similarly oppose to neg-level

 In the last diagram, shouldn't the FF2Q signal be initially high?

 Hi sir, if for a certain timing contraint u give for ex: let me say that my clock period is 5ns and if slack is met using synopsys primetime, so can i say my frequency of operation of my whole ckt is 200MHz ??? kindly reply. Thanks

 Yes. Frequency = 1 / Clock Period

 I apologize, but I differ with the answer. 200 MHz is the frequency which is used as clock input. The slack is met on 200 MHz, then it means the frequency of operation must be bigger than 200 MHz for sure. That number must have been mentioned in the synthesis report.

 Yes even i agree with bhaskar, so even if i am meeting the slack at 5ns it might be possible to meet the slack at 4.5ns although the slack would be less poisitive now but still it might be possible for my design to be running at a much higher frequency.

 Hi @Samiappa -- you are right.. if slack is meeting.. then you can say .. but still there is a "can".. :) means its not 100% true. There are other factors also. Please see my other blogs for details...

 @Indu -- Thanks a lot for such a appreciation.

 For multi-cycle paths remember that driving flop/latch holds/keeps output data without changing for more than one cycle, which is the key. Hence there is more time for data to setup to endpoint and more time for the hold race to not violate.

 You should not be confused. critical path are that path - which has high impact on the design timing. It can be short or may be long path. Point is - if there is any issue in the critical path then you have to fix that one first. you can't even compromise with that path.

 Longest path .. means more number of gates and more delay in that path.

 Hi

 Capture clock period and its path delay together constitute required time of data at the input of capture register.

 i didn't get this point clearly ..is the capture clock period and clock period same or its the delay of the capture clock path

 capture clock period == clock period of capture clock. Means there may be scenerion that there are multiple clocks and different clock are driving the capture flipflop and launching FF. So that's the reason I have mentioned specifically "capture clock period "

 Hello Sir,

 Thank you very much for ur efforts in explaining about STA.

 I have a doubt in MCP example explanation were, you have stated

 "However, if you have a signal in the 60MHz domain that indicates the phase of the 30MHz clock, you can design a circuit that allows for the full 33ns for the clock crossing, then the path from flop30 -> to flop60 is a MCP (again with N=2)."

 why is path between flop30 to flop60 MCP as the launching flop30 operates in slower clock it gives enough time to get sync with flop60 as the next data from flop30 will be launched after two clock cycles at flop60. ( I am taking 30Mhz clock as main clock, as assumed by your statement).

 So may be data from flop60 to flop 30 may take 2 cycles as flop60 as to keep its data stable for complete 2 cycles of its clock (60Mhz clk) to sync with flop30.

 Please let me know if I have understood something wrong.

 Thanks

 Critical path Analysis is a very big topic. Actually It depends how you called a path Critical in your design. Path is critical because it's part of clock path or there is congestion, or setup/holds are violating there.

 So please let me know what exactly you want to know.

 Hi, this is great tutorial, congrats!

 I have a question: in the "what is a setup and hold time?" section you have a TpdDIN, this delay is the same than the data path timing?? that you mentioned in previous sections, this TpdDIN delay is the cloud drawing logic that you have in your previous figures?

 Thanks

 Sir, in your diagram, where you have flip flops UFF1 to UFF3.

 What would happen if the clock period used were shorter than the maximum signal propagation time through the circuit?

 Why do electrical signals take time to propagate through combinatorial logic?

 in STA description its written that its advantage is that it performs timing analysis for all possible paths(whether real or false) but in false path description its written that timing analysis is not done for false path?? im confused..can anyone plz clarify my doubt..

 See.. STA can do analysis of any path.

 But why do you want to do the analysis on false path ?? So we specify that we don't want to do analysis on false path. If you will do the analysis don't make sense and if there are any violations - then you have to unnecessary waste your time to fix it.

 So both statements are correct. :)

 Hi Expert,

 You have done a f=great job..!! Your blog has helped a lot in my interview preparation. But the MCP topic, can you please explain it in more detail, as I am having difficulty in understanding it, esp the 30MHz and 60MHz example.

 can clock network latency be negative ?? (both case ideal propagated) if yes what does it mean

 ??

 I am running one design while report\_timing , (Innovus) i am getting negative network latency .. how it is possible ? In both case , ideal clock and in propagated clock !!

 hello,

 I am bit confused about critical path. When we consider setup critical path should be max delayed path but with respect to hold it should be least delayed path.

 Please help me with this..

 waiting for your reply..

 Hi sir,

 What if the two input of any gate as two different slew?

 I mean at pin A the slew is 10ps and at pin B the slew is 20ps to calculate the delay of that gate using slew and delay table which input slew should consider for the delay?

 Or we should get proceed by the timing path?

 Hi, the example you have provided is an out of phase clock triggered latches. But in "Few Important things" you mentioned time borrowing occur for the same phase of the same clock. Could you please clarify or provide a different example with single clock.

 Hi,

 Its true in both way. means time borrowing can be done when the clocks are out of phase, but that's usually disable by the EDA tools.

 So prefered or say recommended thing is: both the clock should be in phase relation.

 it also confused me, in the example, if L1 & L2 are within the same clock phase, it can not work, right? I don't understand when triggered latch and capture latch are using the same clock, how to borrow? for example, if G1 > 5ns, and CLK1 and CLK2 are both 5ns high in same phase, when signal reaches L2, it is already not enabled.... There must be phase different here then they can borrow, right?

 I think here Fig1 clock1 and clock2 keep a constant phase difference, so they are called in "in phase".

 you could think them just keep a constant clock network delay (skew).

 here out of phase means theire phase difference is a variable.

 YES, The two clocks are out of phase .But In few Important things , they are saying about at the time of borrowing

 You can see the time of borrowing clearly in the second figure. All borrowing occurs in the positive cycle. Both phi1 and phi2

 Hi,

 Most EDA tools recommend not using latches, and will issue warning. The same goes to verilog coding guidelines, where latches could cause stuck state machine. Are these the same latches you are referring to??

 Yes. Latches are not recommended but if you can use timing Borrowing technique, then you can use latches. :)

 I would say that it will be good if you read manual for that. Specifying the tool specific things are out of scope of this series. I can try that later on but right now I am really sorry.

 "In other word we can say that path1 can borrow sometime (3ns) from the path2. Since the sum of path1 and path2 is 10ns, which is the required time of L3, there will be no voilation in either of the Latches." --> If path2 were to take 3ns, can path2 borrow 1ns from path3? I am just wondering because it is not explained. Thanks in advance!

 Hi

 If the latency in clock cycle increases then will the time period go down ? For your example latency is 2 clock cycle.

 suppose path1=2ns path2=8ns then How many clock cycle(latency) is required ?Does borrowing can happen from previous stage in this case ?

 Does pulse register can use time borrowing ?

 what is the difference between time borrowing and cycle stealing ?

 I don't think that a previous stage can borrow time. Since, the whole concept behind time borrowing is that the next latch can wait till it's clock is high. So the combinational circuit before it can produce the result when it's high and it can be transferred to next circuit.

 Hi Guys,

 To understand more about time borrowing in latch based design refer to "http://ohotspot.blogspot.in/2012/09/time-borrowing-and-time-stealing.html" (Understanding ‚ÄúTime Borrowing‚Äù in real designs).

 The last diagram before "few important things" which is supposed to be self-explanatory is not very clear to me. Can someone explain? Thanks!

 Also the statement that an edge triggered design will take 32 ns?

 I read some other blogs that insert a latch between two edge triggered flops..they explain the concept more clearly.
