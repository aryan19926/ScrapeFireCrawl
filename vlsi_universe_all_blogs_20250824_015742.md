### 1. Why clock gating checks not there in shift mode

**Date:** 2025-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2025/04/why-clock-gating-checks-not-there-in.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2025/04/why-clock-gating-checks-not-there-in.html)

### Why clock gating checks not there in shift mode
As we know, [scan chains](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/scan-chains-backbone-of-dft.html) involve shifting the data through scan flops starting from tester through scan\_in port, going through every scan flop in the chain and finally going to tester through scan\_out port.

Now, a clock gating check, in principle, is a signal coming in the path of clock propagation and dynamically switching on/off the clock pulse at the output of the gate. Clock gating check can be visible in static timing analysis because of mode merging or any other reason. And if not valid, can be dispositioned accordingly through "set\_disable\_clock\_gating\_check" command. However, care must be taken to understand all architectural use-cases before disabling the particular clock gating check. In the context of shift mode, let us assume that a clock gating check is being formed. There can be two possible cases:
1\. **The output of the gate is not going to clock pin of a scan flop**: In this case, it is not a valid shift clock gating check. There can be two possible sub-cases:
a. **It is fanning out to a non-clock pin**: In this case, since not going to a valid clock sink, can be ignored right away. However, we must examine properly that the fanout pins dont involve any liberty related issue such as clock attribute missing in lib etc.
b. **The clock pins in fanout are all non-scan flops**: In this case, if the mode in question is pure shift mode and none of the logic on chip is expected to operate functionally, we can consider it to be an invalid clock gating check. However, as said earlier, extreme care must be taken to arrive at this conclusion.
2\. **The output of the gate goes to clock pin of a scan flop**: In this case, if the enable toggles, it will dynamically turn the clock on and off for the scan flop in fanout. As an example, lets assume a scan flop output goes to ICG enable pin. In this case, ignoring SE pin functionality for now, it may make the output of ICG to go 0 for a few clock cycles. During this duration, since the fanout flop(s) dont receive clock, scan chains will have redundant data or loss of data through shifting. Due to this, there will be loss of efficiency in scan shifting, which may be quite costly. Due to this reason, the shift clock path should be without any gating. If any such thing is seen, it would be either a design bug or a missing set\_case\_analysis. For instance, the example in question has missing set\_case\_analysis at ICG/SE pin (see [link](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/integrated-clock-gating-cell.html)).

Thus, the conclusion of this post is that in principle, scan paths dont have any clock gating checks and we can disable all clock gating checks. However, we must adhere to extreme caution to not miss any corner case scenario as discussed above.

### 2. Why there needs to be a lockup latch inserted because of DFT architecture reasons

**Date:** 2025-01
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2025/01/why-there-needs-to-be-lockup-latch.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2025/01/why-there-needs-to-be-lockup-latch.html)

### Why there needs to be a lockup latch inserted because of DFT architecture reasons
In the post [lockup latches](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/06/lockup-latches-soul-mate-of-scan-based.html), we mentioned that it may not be advisable/allowed to have a positive edge triggered flop flop followed by a negative edge-triggered flip-flops in scan chains because of DFT specific reasons. In this post, we will try to undertstand the underlying reason.
First of all, we need to understand the basics of scan timing. A usual scan cycle looks pretty much like the one below. Tester sends shift data once every one cycle, and that usually is during clock low pulse. Image1 below shows typical scanin assertion and scanout observation during shift cycles. Here, I am showing both to be different, but usually they are done concurrently. during the same shift cycle, know obviously to save test time. Thus, every scan cycle consists of a positive and a negative edge.

| Image1: Shiftin and shiftout cycles |
Now, imagine a positive-edge triggered flop feeding to a negative edge-triggered flop. At the end of every scan cycle, both the flops will hold same data. Thus, the tester will not be able to provide "10" or "01" pattern on this pair. This may or may not result in a coverage drop, but it would result in a manual review of the logic to make sure there isnt any.
Similarly, during observation through scan out, tester will never be able to observe data on the output of negative edge flop, because of the redundancy of the data, resulting again in coverage drop.
Thus, the efforts are there to not have any such scenario in the first place during scan stitching. But if there are, a dummy scan element (or lockup latch) is put in place to elongate the data for one cycle. We need to note that doing this increases the scan chain length by 1, which is in contrary to other lockup latch cases. That is why, we are calling this as a dummy scan element.
Thus, now we know, why a positive edge triggered flop followed by a negative edge triggered flop needs a lockup element. Feel free to comment in case of any queries/feedbacks.

### 1. Why NMOS leads to a strong 0 and a weak 1

**Date:** 2024-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2024/11/why-nmos-leads-to-strong-0-and-weak-1.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2024/11/why-nmos-leads-to-strong-0-and-weak-1.html)

### Why NMOS leads to a strong 0 and a weak 1
We frequently hear that an NMOS can pass a strong "0" and only a weak "1". Similarly, a PMOS can only pass a weak "1". But very few people actually know the reason behind this. In this post, we will delve into the details of why NMOS cannot pass a strong "1" and vice-versa.
To understand this, we have to dig deep into the behavior of MOS transistors.

| **Figure 1: Basic MOS structure (NMOS)** |
Figure 1 shows the basic structure of MOS transistor. As we know, the existence of channel (charges) is essential for it to conduct electric current. We have read that channel would exist if (Vgs > Vth), where Vth is threshold voltage of the MOSFET. This is true in case there is no electric current flowing through the channel (Drain being not connected to any voltage).
However, there is a slight correction needed to this understanding, in case there is a current flowing from Source to Drain (or vice-versa). As we know that the channel is a separation between Source and Drain terminals. And naturally, it would have some resistance (for our purpose, it wont matter if the resistance is high or low). And current flowing through a resistance naturally will have some voltage drop across it. The same is shown in figure 2 below.

| Figure 2: NMOS channel as a resistor |
Now, we know that the voltage level at every point in the channel will not be the same, if MOS is conducting electric current. This leads us to expand to already developed understanding. We can not talk about the entire channel, we have to talk of a point "p" in the channel. We can now say that the presence of charges at point "p" will be governed by the potential "Vgp", which is the voltage difference between Gate and point "p". Thus, for the conduction to happen, there needs to be a charge at every point in the channel.

| Figure 3: Charges in NMOS with current flowing |
Since, we have discussed about the principle, we can now go on to discuss about the specific use-case here. We want the NMOS to transmit a "logic 1" signal, which mean Vs = Vg. And Drain is connected through either a capacitance of a resistance to ground, completing a circuit with Source terminal. Let us assume it to be a resistance for simplicity. Initially, since Vs = Vg, it means that Vgs = 0. Hence, there is no channel in the region closer to Source terminal.
This would mean no current should flow, meaning that Vd would be 0V. And channel would exist near Drain region for sure.
Now, there exist a potential difference between Source and Drain terminals, which would cause a current to flow between these through an infinitesimal layer of charges being developed in the channel near source terminal. The exact situation would be something similar to figure 4 below. The infinitesimal layer of charges would extend to a distance which would cause a potential difference of Vth in the channel. And triangular charge distribution signifies different potential of each point in the channel as well. The greater potential difference with respect to gate, more is the amount of charge present at that point.

| Figure 4: Channel formation in NMOS in saturation region |
The limit of this behavior would be reached when Drain reaches a potential (Vg - Vth), thereby entire channel being infinitesimal. Upon trying to further raising voltage above this point, both drain and source would be cut-off. And further raising of voltage of Drain terminal beyond this point wont be possible. Thus, the maximum voltage the drain terminal can reach is Vs - Vth. In other words, a NMOS can never transmit an ideal "1". On similar terms, a PMOS wont be able to transmit an ideal "0" as well.

### 1. Does inserting lockup latch affect Logic Equivalence Check (LEC)

**Date:** 2023-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2023/05/does-inserting-lockup-latch-affect.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2023/05/does-inserting-lockup-latch-affect.html)

### Does inserting lockup latch affect Logic Equivalence Check (LEC)
Logic equivalence check is normally carried out to ensure some processing of the design (example logic synthesis) has not resulted in change of functionality. It flags any logical changes with respect to a golden set of collaterals. There are many applications of logic equivalence checking, some of the prevalent ones pertaining to:
1\. Logic equivalence check between RTL and corresponding synthesized netlist to ensure the logic synthesis has not introduced any functional issues
2\. Logic equivalence check between two sets of netlists after doing netlist edits.
One thing to note here is that since RTL is the starting point here, LEC is done only for the logic present in the RTL, even for netlist vs netlist LEC (exceptions can be there). Other logic, such as scan chains are bypassed by application of certain constraints during LEC. For such logic, there are other methods to ensure correctness, such as scan tracing check to ensure there are no unintentional issues to trace scan chains.
Insertion of lockup latch also falls under non-functional netlist edits, hence not covered under LEC in normal scenarios. We must observe that fanout if lockup latch goes to scan\_in pin of flop, which is not checked under LEC.

Yes, anything that changes (or can potentially change) the FSM behavior will cause LEC fail. And a flop insertion changes FSM behavior.

### 1. Analogy between English and C as a language

**Date:** 2022-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2022/12/analogy-between-english-and-c-as.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2022/12/analogy-between-english-and-c-as.html)

### Analogy between English and C as a language
In our first post, we discussed that any programming language is a language in the first place. So it must be analogous to a language in how the constructs are used and formed in it. In this post, we will try to understand this aspect by making analogous comparison between English and C as a programming language.
As we know that any language has its character set as the most basic construct. English has Roman script as its character set, which includes a-z, A-Z. Similarly, to write a program in any programming language, you must be aware of the character set of that programming language.
The character set of C language is following:
– Alphabets (a-z, A-Z)
– digits (0-9)
– special symbols (any printable symbol like !,&,@,#) etc
In other words, any thing that can be printed forms the character set of C language. You can use these to form bigger constructs that we will discuss later.
Next, we know that in English, characters combine to make words, which have specific meanings. And these words may be of different categories viz nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs etc. On a similar note, in C, we have variables, constants and keywords.
Similar to words combining to form sentences, C has commands/instructions. These instructions carry specific meanings and usually are related to either some task to do for the computer, or some message for the user.
Next in hierarchy, we have paragraphs or essays in English. On a similar note, we have programs in C that carry out a task on a whole. For instance, we might have a program to create a database which is a combination of multiple instructions.
Thus we have discussed how C is analogous to English, or any other language in terms of the constructs. I am pasting below the link of video from my YouTube channel in Hindi. You can go through it if you wish to.

### 2. Starting with C programming language

**Date:** 2022-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2022/12/starting-with-c-programming-language.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2022/12/starting-with-c-programming-language.html)

### Starting with C programming language
Before we start discussing about C as a programming language, we must be clear about the term programming language itself. Only then, we will be able to appreciate C as a programming language.
As the name suggests, programming language is a language. A language that computer understands, and that is used to interact with the heart of the computer. Obviously this language has to be understood by programmers as well, so that the interaction is understood by both the parties. In other words, through a programming language, you are giving instructions to the computer on the tasks it has to perform.
How programming language enables you to interact with computer is a bigger question. A computer does not directly understands the programming language, it understand only electrical signals (high voltage and low voltage, or in simpler terms 0 and 1, also called machine language). Although humans can interpret this coded language, but it is very inefficient and error prone. So we need a translator that converts this series of 0s and 1s into human readable version, the software that does this job is called a compiler or an interpreter based upon the method of translation used. C and other high level languages such as Java, Visual Basic etc are compiled languages, meaning that compiler is the heart of these languages. There are many compilers available for each programming language, for example C has turboC and GCC as compile _rs._ You can understand these as products of different companies, which differ in their characteristics, services and ease of use they provide. But their basic task is to convert C code into computer under-standable 0s and 1s.
For our journey of talking about the basics of C, we will be using an online compiler programiz.com. I personally prefer online compilers because of the obvious benefits they provide; for example, you can access your code from multiple devices. You can use any compiler you wish, or you can use any other compiler as well.
Most of the online compilers provide you with an option to have a pre written code segment, which you can use as a start point for your program. For instance, onlinegdb.com compiler gets you started with a default “Hello world!” printing program. Which you can modify as per your need. Typically, the first program anyone learns to execute in any programming language is to print hello world. We will also use the same to learn basic programming constructs of C language.
![](https://glitteringcode.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/c2cb3eba-99b5-4e69-a391-8ba50df5ddec-2050-0000009b1efab62a_file.jpg?w=1024)
Program to print “hello world” in C language
If you see the screenshot above, a typical C program has following constructs:
1\. #include section: This section is used to include pre compiled C libraries to your code. These are already available C programs in machine language, to perform specific tasks. For example, studio.h enables you to get input from standard terminal and output to standard terminal as well.
2\. Main() section: This is where the execution of a C program starts. Whatever your programs does has to be written directly or indirectly into this section (we will discuss more on this later). For instance, the statement printf is to display on screen, whatever is written within the double quotes. So, when this program executes, “Hello world” will be displayed on the screen.
So that concludes our first post, I hope we will have fun time learning C together. I am pasting below the video link from my YouTube channel in Hindi. You can go through it, if you wish to.

### 1. How to interpret default setup and hold checks

**Date:** 2020-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/11/how-to-interpret-default-setup-and-hold.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/11/how-to-interpret-default-setup-and-hold.html)

### How to interpret default setup and hold checks
In the post "setup and hold checks", we discussed the meaning and interpretation of setup and hold checks. We also discussed the terms "default setup check" and "non-default setup check" and same for hold checks. Essentially, every timing check, be it setup/hold check, data check or clock gating check follows a default edge-relationship depending upon the types of elements involved. For instance, default setup check or setup timing path from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop to a positive edge-triggered flip-flop is full cycle, whereas hold check path is zero cycle. Have you ever thought why is default behavior like this in case of setup and hold checks. Most of us find the setup and hold check interpretation confusing for many cases which are not straightforward, such as positive level-sensitive latch to positive level-sensitive latch timing path. And we believe what the STA tools show us in terms of setup and hold checks. In this post, we will discuss how we can demystify the edge-relationship for setup and hold checks.
For this, we need to understand state machine behavior. Each state of an FSM can be interpreted as an instant of time, and setup check is a bridge between two states of the FSM allowing smooth transition from one state to the next. Every opportunity to alter state machine can be interpreted as one state. For instance, for a state machine comprising only positive edge-triggered flip-flops, every positive edge of clock can be interpreted as a state. Similarly, for a state-machine comprising both positive edge-triggered and negative edge-triggered elements, each (positive or negative) edge is a state. Now, coming to level-sensitive elements, their capturing instant is spread over a time interval rather than being an edge. For example, a positive latch can capture data at any time between positive edge and negative edge. Thus, for a design comprising all kinds of level-sensitive and edge-sensitive elements, the states of the FSM mapped to time should look like as shown in figure 1.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihHlZo6YF8QWWv8IfQsDuTMaH8RFZEVQdfvOMm7iAhmxetALUSvPvTSN5jf4ePzVCY0fYXTvII0RSVcy8B-S2ZEK983l_Bw7HAYD8wlPadj18iseAqgP34So-nHxuxwfcIBd8MM5OuHoPq/w640-h122/picture.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihHlZo6YF8QWWv8IfQsDuTMaH8RFZEVQdfvOMm7iAhmxetALUSvPvTSN5jf4ePzVCY0fYXTvII0RSVcy8B-S2ZEK983l_Bw7HAYD8wlPadj18iseAqgP34So-nHxuxwfcIBd8MM5OuHoPq/s835/picture.png)
**Figure 1: State machine behavior of a generic design**
The FSM behavior shown in figure 1 is in line with commonly understood default FSM behavior. The default setup and hold checks, which are a way of transitioning to adjacent next state, also function the same way. In other words, default behavior of simulation and timing tools is in line with figure 1. It is, of course, possible to design FSMs that do not follow figure 1 through introduction of multi-cycle paths, but if not specified manually, figure 1 is followed.
We will now discuss a rule that will help you to figure out default setup/hold checks between all sequential element types.
**Rule for default setup check**: The very next instant that the data can be captured right after it has been launched, forms the default setup check. For instance, consider a positive edge-triggered flip-flop launching data at T=10 ns, which is to be captured at another flip-flop with clock waveform as shown below (for both launch and capture elements). After T=10ns, the next instant that will capture the data at each type of flop and latch (either positive or negative) is given in figure 2.

Thus, post 10 ns, a positive latch can capture at any instant of time between 10 ns and 15 ns, negative latch can capture the data at any instant between 15 ns and 20 ns; a positive flop will capture the data at 20 ns and a negative flop will capture data at 15 ns. These all form default setup check. The previous such instant that the data could have been captured forms the default hold check. For instance, for positive flop, the instant before 20 ns that could have captured the data is 10 ns itself. Similarly, for negative flop, hold check is at previous negative edge (10 ns launch -> 5ns capture). For positive latch, hold check is also the same as negative flop  (10 ns launch -> 5ns capture) and for negative latch, hold check is same as for positive flop (10 ns launch -> 10 ns capture).
In the below posts, we discuss default setup and hold checks for different elements and for different clock ratios. I hope it covers all. Please let me know for any feedback through comments or email (myblogvlsiuniverse@gmail.com).

I feel for setup the edge should be till the time when the capture element can capture valid data (-tsetup - uncertainties ofcourse) . Which means for a latch as a capture element , the data launched by previous element should be valid till 15ns edge or the latching edge (without time borrowing and without any other deductions ) . According to your post, your setup calculations are very pessimistic for timing, is it not ?
One eg. is latch1 (+ve) -> latch2 (+ve) -> latch3 (+ve) . By your calculations, all the latches will have the same setup time i.e the same edge , since all are open at the same time and will keep transmitting data. But you should be able to write the constraints (without time borrowing) such that = Latch1 -> latch2 should be 15ns mark, latch2->latch3 will be 25ns mark . Let me know if this idea is wrong .

Hi Vishal
Good thinking, this is what happens, you can go through the following post:

And this is not my idea, this is how basic state machines work. :-)

### 2. Default Setup/hold checks - positive flop to negative flop timing paths

**Date:** 2020-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/08/default-setuphold-checks-positive-flop.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/08/default-setuphold-checks-positive-flop.html)

### Default Setup/hold checks - positive flop to negative flop timing paths
The launch/capture event of a positive edge-triggered flip-flop happens on every positive edge of the clock, whereas that of a negative edge-triggered flip-flop occurs on the negative edge of the flip-flop. In this post, we will discuss the default setup/hold checks different cases - same clock, 1:n clock ratio clock and n:1 ratio clock. And this should cover all the possible cases of setup/hold checks.
**Case 1: Both flip-flops getting same clock**
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_ZuMYP-mSRbS2kj9F7o6kOIjl2HC4nVxonKw1s7S_FTp1CaIZrHhqSmM1yOJaL2rFFrmSTneJEkKxF0rH6RsISow2ROpSdlaQO-E3W0TcxDQ0ijXSxoUFq1Jf65yEJZyvAB7SCNkN-7TE/s640/Picture2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_ZuMYP-mSRbS2kj9F7o6kOIjl2HC4nVxonKw1s7S_FTp1CaIZrHhqSmM1yOJaL2rFFrmSTneJEkKxF0rH6RsISow2ROpSdlaQO-E3W0TcxDQ0ijXSxoUFq1Jf65yEJZyvAB7SCNkN-7TE/s1911/Picture2.png)
**Figure 1: Pos-flop to neg-flop default setup/hold checks when clocks are equal in frequency**
Figure 1 shows a timing path from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop to a negative edge-triggered flip-flop. Let us say the data is launched at instant of time "T", which is a positive edge. Then, the next negative edge following time "T" serves as the edge which captures this data; thus forming the default setup check. And the very previous negative edge serves as the hold check. This is shown in the first part of figure 1. Thus, in this case, both setup and hold checks are half cycle.
> **Setup and hold slack equations**
> **Setup slack = Period(clk)/2 + Tskew - Tclk\_q - Tcomb - Tsetup**
> **Hold slack = Period(clk)/2 + Tclk\_q + Tcomb - Tskew - Thold**
**Case 2: Flip-flops getting clocks with frequency ratio N:1 and positive edge of launch clock coincides with negative edge of capture clock**
One of the cases where this happens is when clock is divided by an even number. Another is when odd division is followed by inversion. The resulting waveform will be as shown in figure 2. In this case, each positive edge of launch flip-flop is capable of launching a fresh data, but will be overwritten by next data. Only the one which is launched on the positive edge closest to the negative edge of capture clock will get captured at the endpoint. Similarly, the data which is launched at the edge coinciding negative edge of capture clock must not overwrite the data captured at the same edge. The setup and hold checks, thus formed, are as shown in figure 2 below. The setup check is full cycle of launch clock, whereas hold check is a zero cycle check.

**Figure 2: Default setup/hold checks for case 2**
> **Setup and hold slack equations**
> **Setup slack = period(launch\_clock) + Tskew \- Tclk\_q - Tcomb - Tsetup**
> **Hold slack = Tclk\_q + Tcomb - Tskew - Thold**
**Case 3: Flip-flops gettings clocks with frequency ration N:1 and positive edge of launch clock coincides with positive edge of capture clock**
One of the cases where this happens is when capture of the data happens on an odd divided clock. The resulting setup and hold checks are as shown in figure 3. Both setup and hold checks are half cycle of faster launch clock.

**Figure 3: Default setup/hold checks for case 3**
> **Setup and hold slack equations**
> **Setup slack = period(launch\_clock)/2 + Tskew \- Tclk\_q - Tcomb - Tsetup**
> **Hold slack =  period(launch\_clock)/2 + Tclk\_q + Tcomb - Tskew - Thold**
**Case 4: Flip-flops getting clocks with frequency 1:N and positive edge of launch clock coincides with negative edge of capture clock**
One of the cases is when division is performed after inversion of the master clock and data is launched on the divided clock. Figure 4 shows the default setup/hold checks for this case. In this case, setup check is equal to full cycle of faster clock and hold check is a zero cycle check.

Figure 4: Default setup/hold checks for case 4
> **Setup and hold slack equations**
> **Setup slack = period(capture\_clock) + Tskew \- Tclk\_q - Tcomb - Tsetup**
> **Hold slack = Tclk\_q + Tcomb - Tskew - Thold**
**Case 5: Flip-flops getting clocks with frequency 1:N and positve edge of launch clock coincides with positive edge of capture clock**
This is a case of even division, or inversion, followed by odd division, followed by inversion. The setup and hold checks, both are equal to half cycle of faster clock.

In 1st case setup time should contain time period /2 for setup instead of full period and, also change in hold

This is shown in the first part of figure 1. Thus, in this case, both setup and hold checks are half cycle.
Setup and hold slack equations
Setup slack = Period(clk) + Tskew - Tclk\_q - Tcomb - Tsetup
Hold slack = Tclk\_q + Tcomb - Tskew - Thold
Wont Setup get half cycle path only and hold get benefited by half cycle here?

Not all hold cases are frequency independent. This is the fact. The reason we say hold is frequency independent is because most of the flops in our designs are positive edge triggered only. But there are things beyond that as well. :-)

### 3. Why is the sum of setup time and hold time always positive

**Date:** 2020-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/06/why-is-sum-of-setup-time-and-hold-time.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/06/why-is-sum-of-setup-time-and-hold-time.html)

### Why is the sum of setup time and hold time always positive
In our post " [Setup and hold - origin](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/01/setup-and-hold-device-perspective.html)", we discussed that every device captures data within a certain window known as "setup + hold window". During this time, data must be held stable so that it can be captured properly. Outside this window, data is allowed to toggle.
![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkLCdqIcd7dwzmAp0J2_JHZlx6pe8fT-lToQDOiNoIQ7K_75LSsT2hWAgj1pjJsXmWpvgQso3tfeLRN4mJwGHNstTJnKZnhJbdO_HCQx0ftUPQnDavU7-pl5Vq8weqN5Qhggu9td_2950/s1600/setup+and+hold+checks.png)
Figure above shows "setup+hold window". This window is characterized by the setup and hold times of the device. The width of this window is essentially the sum of setup time and hold time. Thus, if the sum of setup and hold time is positive, it means there is a finite window wherein the device is allowed to capture the data. On the other hand, a negative sum of setup time and hold time indicates that the width of this window is negative. In other words, the window does not exist. So, a negative setup and hold time implies that the device cannot capture the data at all!!
Thus, for a functional device, we always need the sum of setup and hold times to be positive. :-)

But is itn't contradicting to the possibility of having negative setup and hold times in data-to-data checks ?

Hi,
We can have negative setup and hold times as well right? For ex. in case of data-to-data checks.

Hi
Yes, we can have negative setup and hold times, but the sum of setup and hold times should always be positive. It holds a special significance in that the setup + hold window needs to exist which is only possible when the sum is positive

### 4. Timing requirements/constraints related to a reset synchronizer

### Timing requirements/constraints related to a reset synchronizer
In the post [reset synchronizer](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/reset-synchronizer.html), we discussed the functionality associated with a reset synchronizer.  Here, we will discuss the timing associated with a reset synchronizer. Figure 1 below shows a reset synchronizer.

| **Figure 1: Reset synchronizer** |
As we can see, a reset synchronizer is expected to have 3 pins other than a clock pin. We will discuss the timing requirements of each of these one-by-one:
1. R0/D (Data input pin) is tied to 1, hence, no timing requirement related to this.
2. Reset deassertion timing is required for R0/Q -> R1/D at the clock frequency at which reset deassertion is happening
3. Similarly, reset deassertion timing is required for R1/Q -> functional\_flops/Rbar pins
4. Timing at R0/Rbar pin is not required, since, it is put there to absorb metastability and come out of metastability before next clock edge
5. Timing at R1/Rbar pin is not required, since, when Rbar gets deasserted, R1/D and R1/Q are both at value "0".
6. Both R0 & R1 need at least a certain pulse width at Rbar pin in order to detect the reset. This requirement is generally given in the timing model of flip-flop
Points 4 & 5 assume that there is not much skew between R0/Rbar and R1/Rbar, which is true since either there is a custom cell made as a reset synchronizer or both the flip-flops are placed very close to each other, leaving almost no scope for a large skew.
Points 2 & 3 require that reset synchronizer and its fanout flip-flops are clocked on a related clock.
Thus, there are following constraints related to a reset synchronizer:
- Reset synchronizer must be clocked on either same or related clock to its fanout flops
- set\_false\_path -to R0/Rbar
- set\_false\_path -to R1/Rbar
- Min-pulse-width requirement at Rbar pins modelled in timing models

But in this case, the recovery and removal timing are also violated because we are de-asserting the reset signal the same moment the clock edge arrives, thus the functional flip-flops will be brought out of reset at the clock edge too, or do I've got my facts wrong?

Thank you for the clear explanation.
I have two questions,
1\. Suppose we have pll locked signal or other similar control signal like initialization done. We AND this signal with input async reset and connect to Rbar. What will be constraints for this path?
2\. Can we use max\_delay constraint instead of false path for Rbar? What will be the impact of these two types of constraints?

Hi
1\. In this case, you have two sources of asynchronous resets. One is the original async reset signal, and PLL\_LOCK also acts as asynchronous reset signal in this case. So, all the constraints discussed here ill be valid for PLL\_LOCK as well.
2\. max\_delay will constrain the signal to be arriving within a specific time, which is a sub-set of it being unconstrained (false path). So, there will not be any issue here.

“Reset deassertion timing is required for R0/Q -> R1/D at the clock frequency at which reset deassertion is happening”， Why is that “Reset deassertion timing is required” instead of that "setup/hold timing is required"? I think it is a normal data path.

Hi
Reset deassertion timing means timing of setup/hold for deassertion (going from active to inactive state) of reset signal. The reset signal needs to be timed only for deassertion, since assertion will not be related to clock. It travels combinationally from RD->Q

Are "set\_false\_path -to R0/Rbar" and set\_false\_path -to R1/Rbar command necessary? Thank you.

Hi
No, it is not necessary. There can be two cases:
1\. Reset launches on an asynchronous clock. In this case, no impact of set\_false\_path.
2\. Reset launches on synchronous clock. In this case, if you are ok to meet timing, then you may choose not to apply the set\_false\_path.

### 5. Clock relationship between reset synchronizer and fanout flip-flops

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/clock-relationship-between-reset.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/clock-relationship-between-reset.html)

### Clock relationship between reset synchronizer and fanout flip-flops
As we know, all flip-flops which are required to be "out of reset" at the same time are placed in fanout of a single reset synchronizer. In this post, we will discuss if there is any relationship required between clock frequency of reset synchronizer and the clock frequency of the flip-flops in fanout. For now, let us assume that all the flip-flops in the fanout of reset synchronizer work on a single clock "CLK". <dsfdsf> discussed the case when the flip-flops are working on multiple clocks.
Let us first assume that reset synchronizer's clock period is N\*CLK\_PERIOD; i.e. reset synchronizer gets a DIVIDE\_BY\_N clock of the flip-flops' clock. Figure 1 below shows the setup check from a clock with period N\*CLK\_PERIOD to a clock with period CLK\_PERIOD. Since, all the flip-flops have same setup check being formed, all will get out of reset at the same edge; thus, fulfilling the requirement.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgL46KdUCzkogI2eNM1WYbEEeuC_gZIcJG-MX4xmtaTzn0i7W6VZm10zzVmNKNJzmm1A62HfRPZ9Y_vcqqJYkW8HMIHRwpFcaKyiaixZlN_ZmyfhmykWkZ4RjQ0SHvWPSPMANk2sgovJ9R4/s640/Picture1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgL46KdUCzkogI2eNM1WYbEEeuC_gZIcJG-MX4xmtaTzn0i7W6VZm10zzVmNKNJzmm1A62HfRPZ9Y_vcqqJYkW8HMIHRwpFcaKyiaixZlN_ZmyfhmykWkZ4RjQ0SHvWPSPMANk2sgovJ9R4/s1600/Picture1.png)
Similarly, there is a definite setup check from a clock with period CLK\_PERIOD/N to a clock with period CLK\_PERIOD as shown in figure 2 below. Thus, if reset synchronizer works on clock with frequency "N" times the flip-flops in fanout, we get all the flip-flops out of reset at same time, thereby, fulfilling the requirement again.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhUf5U_u-d8kOh-unteBjgjSBCbs00Xmo6RQHikA3Q2YKT0RnIXcCspM7k2LsbeUbkCDNxfe0N0wZ0rwgRdVc2QEfHNavfXKJozrrVv-zvj7bjFTvAMz1tTCwm7b8CY29BncEI26wvaJx6r/s640/Picture2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhUf5U_u-d8kOh-unteBjgjSBCbs00Xmo6RQHikA3Q2YKT0RnIXcCspM7k2LsbeUbkCDNxfe0N0wZ0rwgRdVc2QEfHNavfXKJozrrVv-zvj7bjFTvAMz1tTCwm7b8CY29BncEI26wvaJx6r/s1600/Picture2.png)
Thus, we see that if all the flip-flops in fanout of reset synchronizer work on a single clock, there is no relationship required between frequency of reset synchronizer and frequency of fanout flip-flops as long as we meet the setup and hold requierements.   However, this is not true when flip-flops work on multiple clocks as discussed in <SDFDSF>.

### 6. Design problem: Reset synchronizer clock for multi-frequency flip-flops in fanout

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/design-problem-reset-synchronizer-clock.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/design-problem-reset-synchronizer-clock.html)

### Design problem: Reset synchronizer clock for multi-frequency flip-flops in fanout
**Design problem**: A set of flip-flops, some working on 100 MHz clock and others working on 200 MHz clock are required to come out of reset together. What should be the clock of reset synchronizer
**Solution**: Since all the flip-flops are required to come out of reset in the same cycle, all these must get reset from a single reset synchronizer. Now, as the question states that the flip-flops in the fanout of reset synchronizer are working on two clocks. We need to find the correct-by-design clock that reset synchronizer should be working on. Let us assume that the correct clock to be connected to reset synchronizer is one of the two frequencies given.

| **Figure 1: Reset synchronizer** |
First, let us check by assuming that reset synchronizer works on positive edge of 100 MHz clock. Figure 2 shows the setup checks for 100 MHz -> 100 MHz and 100 MHz -> 200 MHz paths. Let us say, reset deassertion propagates to R1/Q at edge **(1)**. Going by figure 2, all flip-flops working on 200 MHz clock will be out of reset at edge **(3)** and all flop-flops working on 100 MHz will be out of reset at edge **(5)**. **Thus, reset synchronizer working on positive edge of 100 MHz clock does not solve our purpose**.
|     |

| **Figure 2: Reset synchronizer works on positive edge of 100 MHz clock** |
Now, let us check the same when reset synchronizer works on positive edge of 200 MHz clock. In this case, reset can deassert either on edge **(1)** or edge **(3)**. If reset deasserts on edge 3, then, we have both the categories of flops coming out of reset at same time edge **(5)**. But if reset deasserts on edge **(1)**, both categories of flops get out of reset at different times. Thus, we can get the reset synchronizer working on 200 MHz clock, but we have to ensure by design that reset gets deasserted on the edge of 200 MHz clock that coincides with negative edge of 100 MHz clock. Figure 3 and figure 4 discuss these scenarios.

| **Figure 4: Reset synchronizer works on positive edge of 200 MHz clock coinciding with negative edge of 100 MHz clock** |
Same scenarios are expected as figure 3 & 4 when we make reset synchronizer work on negative edge of 200 MHz clock.
Now, let us explore the last option; i.e., reset synchronizer working on negative edge of 100 MHz clock. In this case, as shown in figure 5, both 100 MHz and 200 MHz flip-flops come out of reset on same edge. Thus, this case works perfectly. Figure 5 illustrates this.

What if the fanout flops are clocked with 100MHz and 400 MHz (instead of 200 in above example), in that case this solution would not work right? So what is general solution ?

Hi
In my opinion, this is the general solution, this will work for 100MHz/400MHz combo as well.

Can you please explain this? According to me, for 100/400MHz combo, if we consider negative edge of 100MHz there will be one positive of 400MHz before the posedge of 100MHz, thus causing reset at different time instants.

Hi
Yes, in that case, you are right. In general scenario, you can launch on the faster clock and architecturally ensure that it always launches on the N-1th edge.

Hi
So in above example, you consider a case when fanout flops are getting synchronous clocks. What if the fanout clocks are asynchronous or no phase relationship?

Hi A synchronizer is always, in principle, inserted with the capture clock being in phase to the clock of synchronizer. There can be exceptions to it, and that means you would do the same without syncronizer as well.

### 7. Data check timing paths

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/data-check-timing-paths.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/data-check-timing-paths.html)

### Data check timing paths
Data check is a timing check, either picked from timing model or user-defined, between two related data signals. Thus, data check timing path is a timing path, wherein both reference signal and constrained signal are data signals launched by same or related clocks. Figure 1 below shows an example data check path where both signals are launched from positive edge-triggered flip-flops. Based upon the type of check being formed (data setup check or data hold check), we can categorize these as data-setup-check path or data-hold-check path.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgTzFp2YuUxzrz4RCazJyNlOG5id0i-89KYx2XnDMDtPsHTlwx1F7Idq-SHjzPejDsZigh6Gx8NJdxrwjXDOneiY111eFbaehc0GjIdsvtZsxxz7oTaEL5-srGHnV3GzdQMgshHsDuo7hYX/s640/Picture1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgTzFp2YuUxzrz4RCazJyNlOG5id0i-89KYx2XnDMDtPsHTlwx1F7Idq-SHjzPejDsZigh6Gx8NJdxrwjXDOneiY111eFbaehc0GjIdsvtZsxxz7oTaEL5-srGHnV3GzdQMgshHsDuo7hYX/s1600/Picture1.png)
**Constraining data-check timing paths**: To constrain data-check timing paths, we first need to ensure that there is a data-check associated with the signals in question. It can either be defined in the timing model being picked or we can define using SDC construct "set\_data\_check". Once data check is defined, we can simply ensure that both the reference signal and constrained signal are launched from same clock or related clock to see data-check timing path reported.

### 8. Clock gating timing paths

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/clock-gating-timing-paths.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/clock-gating-timing-paths.html)

### Clock gating timing paths
A timing path falls under the category of clock gating timing paths, when:
1. The endpoint is the "EN" pin of Integrated Clock Gating (ICG) cell   OR
2. The endpoint is one of the input pins of a combinational cells with at least one of the other pins getting a clock signal
The motive behind a clock gating timing path being treated as a constrained path is to constrain the path in such a way that there is no glitch or metastability observed at the output of the gate. In other words, either the output of the gate transmits complete pulses of clock; or it does not transmit any signal at all. The max and min checks in case of clock gating paths are called as "clock gating setup check" and "clock gating hold checks". The startpoint for these paths can be any of input port or a sequential element. Figure 1 below shows a few examples of clock gating timing paths.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEif3l96dBw1HmT8jEmCCt9LGBabMPsoT6NsOnvX1p1LCUoNS57mUlKFPoaNHwylARBWMicvv9Oavnq4kkp9R9UYaSa6dogUyYNvkXguar9qOBUeDWB6GSXSiBoACpxLhqfr71E_awDdOr_A/s640/Picture7.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEif3l96dBw1HmT8jEmCCt9LGBabMPsoT6NsOnvX1p1LCUoNS57mUlKFPoaNHwylARBWMicvv9Oavnq4kkp9R9UYaSa6dogUyYNvkXguar9qOBUeDWB6GSXSiBoACpxLhqfr71E_awDdOr_A/s1600/Picture7.png)
**Constraining clock gating check timing paths**: As explained in [clock gating checks](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/05/clock-switching-and-clock-gating-checks.html), there are two types of clock gating checks - one which require data at the endpoint to change when clock is low (AND-type check) and vice-versa (OR-type check). There are scenarios when STA tool is able to recognize the type of check being formed. This happens when the endpoint is a simple gate such as AND or OR gate. In that case, by default, these are constrained as clock gating endpoints. The only thing we have to do is to ensure that proper clock signals reach the startpoint and the endpoint. But there are scenarios when the gate is complex and it is not possible for STA tool to differentiate which of the two types of checks should be formed. In those cases, these are not by-default constrained. And we have to specifically ask the STA tool to treat these as clock gating endpoints by using "set\_clock\_gating\_check" SDC command, in addition to defining proper clocks.

### 9. Reg-to-out paths

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/reg-to-out-paths.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/reg-to-out-paths.html)

### Reg-to-out paths
A reg-to-out path has a sequential element as the "startpoint" and an output port as "endpoint". We can categorize reg-to-out paths as flop-to-out and latch-to-out, but this differentiation is not widely prevalent. Figure 1 below shows a reg-to-out path originating from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYQkEZMXoELJXVNgCz9jkWlBQARD0oWxU3ltDNW5u6qO6w44UiSsTWB6XCNyY0UDA04_PqGtI29whBXwkufvZyyrfAjkt443miAKBqG5uFvvnVXRpCDMpxO9eObCjU0yznTsl9zVIm7ofs/s400/Picture1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYQkEZMXoELJXVNgCz9jkWlBQARD0oWxU3ltDNW5u6qO6w44UiSsTWB6XCNyY0UDA04_PqGtI29whBXwkufvZyyrfAjkt443miAKBqG5uFvvnVXRpCDMpxO9eObCjU0yznTsl9zVIm7ofs/s1600/Picture1.png)
The output port as an "endpoint" is modeled as an alternative of a flip-flop capturing data outside. The SDC command for doing so is "set\_output\_delay". It represents the portion of data path and clock skew outside the design. Also, we have not shown the clock path in the above figure. The clock source may be situated inside the design and provide clock to outside sitting flip-flop (more commonly called as master transmit or clock-out-data-out in I/O protocol jargon). Or it may be situated outside, thereby, sending data to internal flip-flop through another port (commonly called as clock-in-data-out or slave transmit mode in I/O protocol jargon). Both these scenarios are shown in figures 2 and 3 below.

**Constraining reg-to-out paths**: As we discussed earlier also, we model the data path and clock path that is not visible inside the design for reg-to-out paths using "set\_output\_delay" command. There are two cases for constraining output ports:
**Case 1**: Constraining with respect to virtual clock
> Constraining with virtual clock is helpful when we know that the data-path budgeting is exclusive of clock path, for instance, a sub-design of an SoC. A virtual clock is a clock without any source. So, data-path outside the block can be modeled using "set\_output\_delay" with respect to virtual clock and clock path outside the block can be modeled using "set\_clock\_latency" for virtual clock. The steps are listed below:
- "create\_clock" at clock source : CLK
- "create\_clock" without a clock source : VCLK (virtual clock)
- set\_output\_delay at output port with respect to VCLK
**Case 2**: Constraining with respect to real clock
> When we know that the outside data path delay and clock path delay are fixed, then we can constrain the port with respect to real clock itself. The steps are listed below:
- "create\_clock" at clock source : CLK
- "set\_output\_delay" at output\_port with respect to CLK (or with respect to a clock related to CLK)

### 10. In-to-reg paths

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/in-to-reg-paths.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/in-to-reg-paths.html)

### In-to-reg paths
An in-to-reg path has an input port as "startpoint" and a sequential element as the "endpoint". Similar to reg-to-reg paths, we can categorize these into in-to-flop and in-to-latch paths; but this differentiation is not prevalent widely. Figure 1 below shows a sample in-to-reg path ending at a positive edge-triggered flip-flop.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhu4Ro9s5DUpfMmENK7gttaPukQiIHBABtpqqq8NSS7Cf6Cnu1zBkVw_KEIKc6vsc4Y4so3jwAakt2QwASZQGlv9TFRoSb_5KV50Fe6HXcJqDF9QqluRH2lkYUNY7KEQfrGeWI3oRfm4xV7/s400/Picture2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhu4Ro9s5DUpfMmENK7gttaPukQiIHBABtpqqq8NSS7Cf6Cnu1zBkVw_KEIKc6vsc4Y4so3jwAakt2QwASZQGlv9TFRoSb_5KV50Fe6HXcJqDF9QqluRH2lkYUNY7KEQfrGeWI3oRfm4xV7/s1600/Picture2.png)
The input port as a startpoint is modelled as an alternative of a flip-flop launching data from the outside. The SDC command for doing so is "set\_input\_delay". It represents the portion of total clock period and clock skew that is outside the design. Also, we have not shown the clock source in the above figure. The clock source may be situated inside the design and provide clock to the outside sitting flip-flop (more popularly called as clock-out-data-in or master receive mode in terms of I/O protocol jargon). Or it may be situated outside, thereby sending clock signal to the internal flip-flop through another port (more popularly called as clock-in-data-in or slave receive mode in I/O protocol jargon). Both these scenarios are shown in figures 2 and 3 below.

**Constraining in-to-reg paths**: As we discussed earlier, we model the data-path and clock-path that is not visible inside the design for in-to-reg paths. This is done using "set\_input\_delay" command. There are two cases for constraining input ports:
**Case 1**: Constraining with respect to virtual clock
> Constraining with virtual clock is helpful when we know that the data-path budgeting is exclusive of clock path, for instance, a sub-design of an SoC. A virtual clock is a clock without any source. So, data-path outside the block can be modelled with "set\_input\_delay" with respect to virtual clock and clock path outside the block can be modeled using "set\_clock\_latency" for virtual clock. The steps are listed below:
- "create\_clock" at clock source
- "create\_clock" without any source (virtual clock)
- set\_input\_delay at input\_port with respect to virtual clock created
**Case 2**: Constraining with respect to real clock
> When we know that the outside data path delay and clock path delay are fixed, then we constrain the input port with respect to real clock itself. An example is SoC level protocol signals such as ethernet signals.  The input port is constrained either with respect to the same clock going to the endpoint or some clock related to it. The steps are listed below:
- "create\_clock" CLK at clock source
- "set\_input\_delay" at input\_port with respect to CLK (or with respect to a generated\_clock created from the CLK

### 11. Reg-to-reg paths

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/reg-to-reg-paths.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/reg-to-reg-paths.html)

### Reg-to-reg paths
In a reg-to-reg path, both startpoint and endpoint are sequential elements; i.e. either an edge-triggered element or a level sensitive element. Edge-triggered elements are mostly flip-flops, memories or edge-triggered arcs of sub-partitions of the design. Level sensitive elements are mostly latches or any such element such as a sub-partitions level sensitive arcs. Edge-triggered elements can be commonly referred as flops as far as our scope is concerned. Similarly, level-sensitive elements can be referred to as latches.
Reg-to-reg timing paths can be broadly categorized into four categories depending upon if the startpoint and endpoint is level-triggered or edge-sensitive:
- **Flop-to-flop paths**: Both startpoint and enpoint are edge-triggered (flops). See [Setup and hold checks for flop-to-flop paths](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/setup-and-hold-checks-static-timing.html)
- **Flop-to-latch paths**: Startpoint is edge-triggered and endpoint is level-sensitive. See [setup and hold checks for flop-to-latch paths](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/08/setup-and-hold-checks-part-ii-static.html)
- **Latch-to-flop paths**: Startpoint is level-sensitive and endpoint is edge-triggered. See [setup and hold checks for latch-to-flop paths](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/latch-to-reg-setup-hold-checks.html)
- **Latch-to-latch paths**: Both startpoint and endpoint are level-sensitive. See setup and hold checks for latch-to-latch paths
**Common characteristics of reg-to-reg paths**:
- All the components of a timing path we discussed in [timing paths](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/timing-paths.html), i.e. startpoint, endpoint, launch clock path, capture clock path and data path exist for a reg-to-reg path.
- To constrain reg-to-reg paths, we just have to ensure that both the startpoint and endpoint receive a valid clock signal and there is no timing exception (such as false path between the clocks) masking the timing path.

### 12. Timing paths

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/timing-paths.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/timing-paths.html)

### Timing paths
The most important element of a design in Static Timing Analysis is a timing path. A design is broken down into a set of timing paths. Each timing path is analyzed by a set of timing equations for possible violations of timing. A timing path can be defined as flow of timing information (such as delay, transition etc.) through a set of elements which can be accumulated and verified against a specified set of rules.
A timing path can be supposed to be consisting of two sub-paths - a reference path through which reference signal traverses and a constrained path through which constrained signal traverses. Both of these essentially originate from same source (or have a definite relationship at their respective sources). At the terminal end of both, there is a relationship governing the arrival of constrained signal to the arrival of reference signal. Depending upon the type of reference signal and constrained signal, the type of elements encountered by these and the check that is formed between the two, we govern the type of path. For instance, in a reg-to-reg setup path, the reference signal is clock, constrained signal is data launched from a clock and traversing through a flip-flop and the check that is formed between the two signals is a setup check at a flip-flop as the endpoint.

| **Figure 1: Generic timing path in STA** |
Figure 1 above shows a generic timing path. The elements of the path are not shown individually. The path that is common among constrained signal and reference signal is termed as common path.
Based upon type of check being formed between constrained signal and reference signal, there are commonly two types of paths that are formed: max path/setup check path and hold check path/min path.
**Max/setup check path**: In this kind of path, the earliest arrival of reference signal and latest arrival of constrained signal is considered. The kind of check is known as setup check in most of the cases. And the type of path is called setup path/max path.
**Min/hold check path**: In this kind of paths, the earliest arrival of constrained signal and the latest arrival of reference signal is considered. The kind of check is known as hold check in most of the cases. And the type of path is called hold path/min path.
Let us move to the commonly perceived understanding of a timing path by taking an example of a reg-to-reg path. Figure 1 below shows an example of a timing path, which starts from a flip-flop and ends at a flip-flop.

| **Figure 2: Components of a reg-to-reg path** |
The above timing path (or any timing path, in general), has following components:
**Startpoint**: The element from which the data gets launched is known as startpoint. In general, it can be a sequential element (latch, flip-flop) or an input port. In case it is a flip-flop, the clock pin of the flip-flop is counted as the startpoint of timing path. For point-to-point paths, it can also be a combinational input or output pin.
**Endpoint**: The element at which timing path ends is called the endpoint. It can be data pin of flip-flop or an output port. For point-to-point paths, it can also be a combinational input or output pin.
**Clock**: Most of the timing paths are constrained by a clock signal, which clocks both startpoint and endpoint. The properties of the clock signal, such as clock period, jitter etc are defined in timing constraints.
**Launch clock path**: It refers to the path traversed by clock signal from clock source to the startpoint.
**Capture clock path**: It refers to the path traversed by clock signal from clock source to the endpoint.
**Data path**: It refers to the path traversed by data signal from starptoint to endpoint.
In the above example, launch clock path and data path together constitute constrained signal path and capture clock path constitutes reference signal path.

### 13. Timing path types

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/timing-path-types.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/timing-path-types.html)

### Timing path types
In the post - [timing paths](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/timing-paths.html)\- we discussed about timing paths and common components of a timing path. We also discussed that the type of a timing path is perceived by its components, the elements encountered in reference path, the elements encountered in constrained path and the type of check between reference signal and constrained signal. We also discussed how these signal traversals are differentiated into different components of timing paths - startpoint, endpoint, launch clock path and capture clock path. Based on these, we can categorize the timing paths into broadly following categories. We will not talk about min/hold and max/setup paths, but each of below categories can further be differentiated into these based upon the type of check being formed. Also, it is to be noted that every timing path is, essentially, either of the type of a generic timing path or a modeling in some or the other form of  a generic timing path as shown in figure 1.

| **Figure 1: Generic timing path** |
**Reg-to-reg paths**: The timing path where both "startpoint" and "endpoint" are sequential elements, e.g. a flip-flop, a latch or a memory element is termed as a reg-to-reg path in common terminology.
**In-to-reg path**: The timing path where "startpoint" is an input port and "endpoint" is a sequential element, is termed as in-to-reg path.
**Reg-to-out path**: Here, "startpoint" is a sequential element and "endpoint" is an output port.
**In-to-out path**: In this type of path, "startpoint" is an input port and "endpoint" is and output port.
**Clock gating paths**: In this type of path, "startpoint" can be any out of sequential element, input port or output port. The endpoint is usually input pin of either a combinational gate or an Integrated Clock Gating cell (ICG). The common scenario involved is to time the arrival of constrained signal (termed as enable in clock gating paths) such that complete pulses of clock as reference signal are transmitted and there is no glitch at the output of the "endpoint".
**Min-pulse-width-check paths**: Here, both reference and constrained path, both are clock paths and common right from source till "endpoint". This type of path compares the latest arrival of rise transition of the clock with respect to the earliest arrival of fall transition of clock and vice-versa. The nature of check is max check only.
**Data check paths**: In this type of paths, both reference signal and constrained signal are data launched by a clock signal.
**Point-to-point paths**: The paths with only constrained signal are called as point-to-point paths. "startpoint" as well "endpoint" can be any sequential or combinational pin or port.

### 14. Min-pulse-width-check timing paths

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/min-pulse-width-check-timing-paths.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/min-pulse-width-check-timing-paths.html)

### Min-pulse-width-check timing paths
All sequential elements require the clock pulse to have a pulse of at-least a certain width in order to function correctly. This is coded in their timing models in terms of a "minimum pulse width" requirement. And the timing path pertaining to check minimum pulse width of a signal is termed as "min-pulse-width-check" timing path. A min-pulse-width-check timing path essentially checks the arrival of one transition of the clock at the endpoint with respect to its fall transition. In other words, both constrained signal and reference signal are the same, just the opposite transitions.
For instance, min-pulse-width-check timing path for a high pulse will have fall transition as the reference signal and rise transition as constrained signal. The latest arrival of rise transition is checked against earliest arrival of fall transition Similarly, min-pulse-width-check timing path for a low pulse will have fall transition as constrained signal and rise transition as reference signal. The latest arrival of fall transition will be checked against earliest arrival of rise transition.
**Constraining min-pulse-width-check timing paths**: There are two kind of scenarios:
- Min-pulse-width requirement for the pin is picked from timing model
- User specifically specifies a "min-pulse-width" check at a specific pin using "set\_min\_pulse\_width" command. This may be required in certain scenarios, such as a clock going out of the design through an output port, and we need to maintain a minimum duty cycle for the outgoing clock.
Regardless of this, we just need to define a clock of required period and we can report min-pulse-width-check timing path as desired.

### 15. In-to-out paths

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/in-to-out-paths.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/in-to-out-paths.html)

### In-to-out paths
In-to-out paths start from an input port and end at an output port. Figure 1 below shows an in-to-out path. As shown in figure 1, most of the times (not always), in-to-out paths are subset of a reg-to-reg path seen from a higher level of hierarchy. For instance, an in-to-out path at the level of a block-level design may be a reg-to-reg path as seen at SoC flat.

For in-to-out paths, the clock path is always assumed fully outside the design.
**Constraining in-to-out paths**: There are two ways that we can constrain in-to-out paths:
> **Constraining with respect to a virtual clock**: We can consider in-to-out path as a sub-segment of a larger reg-to-reg path. And we can constrain these paths using a virtual clock. Using "set\_input\_delay" for input port and "set\_output\_delay" for output port with respect to same virtual clock, these paths can be constrained.
- Create a clock VCLK without any source
- "set\_input\_delay" at input\_port with respect to VCLK
- "set\_output\_delay" at output\_port with respct to VCLK
> **Constraining as point-to-point paths**: We can constrain in-to-out paths using "set\_max\_delay" command as point-to-point paths. However, using this approach, we may need to apply some extra constraints as well depending upon the behavior of the tool we are using.

### 16. Where does STA fit in backend design flow

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/where-does-sta-fits-in-design-flow.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/where-does-sta-fits-in-design-flow.html)

### Where does STA fit in backend design flow
Static Timing Analysis (STA) is an integral part of backend design cycle. At each stage in the design cycle, it is imperative to check for timing violations by carrying out static timing analysis and do course correction, if required. A typical physical design cycle involves logic synthesis followed by test insertion, placement, clock tree synthesis and data routing. At each of these stages, we need to ensure that the timing is under control by running STA. Figure 1 below shows, on a higher level, different steps involved in physical design cycle; and how STA is an integral part of each of the stages.
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqAST2Fa0N14RbzH_ctta1MXcXnxvxLJNzpuW5SdKIeFTU_HuhSp-4JhxO6EiDP2LAMXUDATeJxt_cSjdGJy_FmPyHkkSvBqXwoYnD-0g_lBb4VV2dfwLuiRcJ33aHW8jjNA52tMxQcLeS/s400/Picture2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqAST2Fa0N14RbzH_ctta1MXcXnxvxLJNzpuW5SdKIeFTU_HuhSp-4JhxO6EiDP2LAMXUDATeJxt_cSjdGJy_FmPyHkkSvBqXwoYnD-0g_lBb4VV2dfwLuiRcJ33aHW8jjNA52tMxQcLeS/s1600/Picture2.png) |
| **Figure 1: STA as an integral part of physical design cycle** |
The first step in physical design cycle is synthesis and test insertion followed by floorplanning and placement. Although, nowadays, some tools combine synthesis and placement to save on run time and efforts. At this level, STA is run with ideal clocks and estimated parasitic values either on the basis of fanout with a model known popularly as WLM (Wire Load model) or on the basis of actual placement of instances. Since, a lot of variables are not taken into account at this stage, it is preferred to meet setup timing with some margin so as to accommodate the degradation in setup timing due to those variables later in the design cycle. These variables include clock skew, uncommon path in clock network, data nets detouring during actual routing and crosstalk effects. When clock tree is built, we have actual clock skew numbers. So, STA needs to be run to check if the margins for clock skew need to be accommodated into some more optimization (area, power or timing) due to actual clock skews and uncommon clock paths being different than the margin assumed. Similarly, after data routing, we can run STA with actual parasitic values and crosstalk effects, thereby signing off timing using STA by running accross all possible corner scenarios.

### 17. Static Timing Analysis

**Date:** 2020-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/static-timing-analysis.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/static-timing-analysis.html)

### Static Timing Analysis
**What is STA**: STA (Static Timing Analysis) is a method to validate the timing performance and hence, functionality of the designs. STA is based upon calculating the limits of minimum and maximum delay of logic elements through timing models. Using these calculated delays and based upon a set of equations, it is, then, determined if the design will pass or not.
An interesting thing to note about STA is that there is no importance given to actual functionality or state machine model of the design. The only thing of concern is how fast and accurately maximum and minimum delay bounds can be calculated.
**Why is STA important**: An SoC is supposed to run in a range of temperatures and voltages. Also, there are variations in process parameters while manufacturing chips. To guarantee performance  and functionality across all combinations, it is important to analyze timing and check for any possible timing failures. STA is a very fast method to achieve the same as opposed to dynamic timing simulations (spice simulations). In other words, STA is one of the most important steps of chip design flow to check the design performance with respect to timing constraints.
**How STA works**: As stated earlier, STA works on calculating timing bounds and validating against a set of timing equations. One of the most important aspects of timing is the delay of individual elements and overall delay between sequential elements. Let us consider a flip-flop sending some signal to another flip-flop through a combinational logic as shown in figure 1 below.
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSwcOs91v3-yjKmqXndd1YGMOFDiJYVJIUlOaQWI21BdgQuhleoVuiYVercCJEt3RZkRNfdX0e1v0wlrwlXj5oocNqPFaLK5mggnId0QPK2u0CafRxXHGbpvpuGLUY9CMznrKOHhowdKTP/s640/Picture1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSwcOs91v3-yjKmqXndd1YGMOFDiJYVJIUlOaQWI21BdgQuhleoVuiYVercCJEt3RZkRNfdX0e1v0wlrwlXj5oocNqPFaLK5mggnId0QPK2u0CafRxXHGbpvpuGLUY9CMznrKOHhowdKTP/s1600/Picture1.png) |
| **Figure 1: A sample signal propagation between two sequential elements** |
For the above to work properly, signal that is launched from **FLOP1** on a clock edge should reach **FLOP2** only after hold time has passed after the clock edge (definition of hold check). Thus, the sum of minimum delay values of all the elements from **FLOP1** to **FLOP2** must be greater than hold time of **FLOP2**, thus giving below equation for minimum delay limit.
FLOP1\_delay (CK\_to\_Q\_min) + NET1\_delay(min) + CELL1\_delay(A\_to\_Z\_min) + NET2\_delay(min) + CELL2+delay(A\_to\_Z\_min) + NET3\_delay - FLOP2\_hold > 0
Similarly, the signal launched from **FLOP1** on a clock edge should reach **FLOP2** setup time before the next clock edge (definition of setup check). Thus, the sum of maximum delay values of all the elements from **FLOP1** to **FLOP2** must be less than time period of clock received by both flops - setup time of FLOP2, thus giving below equation for maximum delay limit.
FLOP1\_delay (CK\_to\_Q\_max) + NET1\_delay(max) + CELL1\_delay(A\_to\_Z\_max) + NET2\_delay(max) + CELL2\_delay(A\_to\_Z\_max) + NET3\_delay < CLK\_period - FLOP2\_setup
Of course, we can differentiate max delay as rise\_max/fall\_max and min delay as rise\_min/fall\_min. But for simplicity, we chose not to differentiate. Also, we considered ideal scenario wherein clock arrives at the same time on both the flip-flops, and no cross-talk effects.
Now the question arises how all the delays mentioned are calculated. If you observe carefully, there are three kinds of delays mentioned above: cell delays, net delays and setup/hold check values. For cell delays and setup/hold check values, there are cell timing models, in liberty format in most of the cases. Liberty format implements a lookup-table based delay model which is a set of values varying with transition and load values. These values are interpolated based upon the actual load and slew values to calculate cell delays. For net delays, tools implement a delay calculation engine based upon parasitic values of the nets. There is a different model of such values for each of the corner-case scenarios; and STA is run separately for each such scenario to provide a complete coverage of the design accross all use-case scenarios.
**How is STA different than dynamic simulations**: Dynamic timing analysis needs a set of input vectors to work. It works by propagating actual values and calculating actual differential equations as provided in spice models, which are quite effort intensive. Moreover, the set of input vectors for a design with 50 inputs itself will be so big that it is not possible to run dynamic simulations at all possible corner-case scenarios for all set of input vectors. On the other hand, static timing analysis works on delay bounds without the need of any input vectors; and hence, is pretty fast. That is why, static timing analysis is a more popular way of timing analysis. On the other hand, of course, dynamic analysis is more accurate. So, the paths passing with very-very small margins can be run through spice simulations as well in order to be extra cautious about the robustness of the design against failures. Thus, in all, the overall approach can be to have both static as well as dynamic analysis for timing, with static timing analysis providing a complete coverage and dynamic simulations being a confidence booster for design robustness against failures by checking for real application specific input vectors.

1\. Will STA needs to be performed for all PVT corners or else, for setup (worst case) one corner, for hold (worst case)one corner alone is sufficient?
2\. i'm not able to get the advantages of dynamic simulation, very-very small margins means. can you please elaborate

Hi
1\. The irony is that a single corner is not worst for setup and hold. For setup, the dominant corner is supposed to be the one having worst delay. In other words, sum of all cells and nets being worst will decide the worst timing for the path. Out of all the combinations of PVT & RC, cell delay is worst in timing corner where net capacitance is max. Net delay is worst in the corner in which RC is maximum. Also, due to temperature inversion, we cannot choose a single temperature for all cell types. Some cell types will have worst delay at max T and vice-versa. Thus, there are a combination of timing corners which are setup critical.
Also, hold is essentially a skew check between data and clock from common point. So, it can arise in any corner. So, hold must be signed off in as many corners as possible.
2\. By this, I meant that since STA is less accurate; there are two options:
a) Inaccuracy lies on both sides. In other words, a path with almost zero (but positive) slack can fail is the inaccuracy of the path lies on negative side. Dynamic simulations, which are more accurate will help catch the actual failing paths.
b) If we choose STA to be over-pessimistic so as to make inaccuracy always positive; then, if a path has some negative slack, it may happen that a small negative slack on the path is actually positive. So, we may choose dynamic simulations to signoff paths that are actually failing because of over-pessimistic STA.
I hope I was able to explain my point. :-)

Hi,

### 18. How clock gating reduces power dissipation

**Date:** 2020-03

### How clock gating reduces power dissipation
As discussed in [clock gating - basics](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/clock-gating.html), enable signal coming in data path is transferred into clock path in order to save dynamic power. But the question is exactly how is this power saved. In this post, we will discuss the same.

A flip-flop implemented as a standard cell mostly has two internal inverters to generate clk' and clk\_delay signals. So, even if the flip-flop input is kept constant, there is still toggling of data at these inverters, thereby dissipating dynamic power. In addition to this, there is internal power dissipation inside flip-flop due to charging and discharging of transistors' gates repetitively because of clock toggling, but this component is not a significant factor compared to dynamic power of inverters. Figure 2 below shows the internal structure of flip-flop, which has two latches in master-slave configuration and two inverters in clock path.

| **Figure 2: Flip-flop internal structure** |
Every clock cycle, these two inverters toggle regardless of flip-flop output toggling. However, implementation of clock gating will prohibit the toggling of these inverters when data is not toggling. Let us assume that a latch-based ICG is inserted. Thus, a mux in data path is replaced by an ICG in clock path. But there is a difference here. If there are, say 1000, flip-flops with same enable signal, there will be a common ICG inserted for these. Thus, instead of now 2000 inverters (inside 1000 flops) toggling when flip-flop output will be constant, we have only 2 inverters inside ICG consuming dynamic power. This is how dynamic power is saved. However, if only 1 flop had been clock gated in this manner, there would not have been any dynamic power saving, instead we have an ICG instead of a latch, it may result in overall loss in terms of area and power.
Whether there is any net saving is governed by how many flips-flops have been clock gated using a single ICG.
Also, as discussed, many muxes in data path with same enable are replaced by an ICG in clock path. Thus, there are advantages in terms of area and leakage power too, in addition to dynamic power.

Nice information.. we will get expected data output from flipflop, But to the input clock of flipflop we are sending ANDed result of En and Clk.. what if En signal is low for 3 cycles and high for 2 cycles.. then Flipflop's input clock doesn't have 50% dutycycle.? id that fine?

Hi, if En signal is high for 2 cycles and low for 3 cycles, clock will have 50% duty cycle for 2 cycles and 0% duty cycle for 3 cycles (speaking in ideal terms). :-) So no issue here.
However, in reality also, the clock is never expected to have a 50% duty cycle. The buffers/inverters in clock path distort the clock waveform by at least minimal amount.

### 19. Design query : How can we construct a 101 non overlapping counter using only combinational circuit for 32 bit input for example on considering 10101001 i want an output as 1 since there is only 1 101 non overlapping sequence

**Date:** 2020-03

### Design query : How can we construct a 101 non overlapping counter using only combinational circuit for 32 bit input for example on considering 10101001 i want an output as 1 since there is only 1 101 non overlapping sequence
Solution: The design in question is a combinatorial design with 32-bit input (given) and a 4-bit output as shown in figure 1 below. How the output is 4-bit is a bit tricky. For this, we have to understand the problem. We have to count the number of non-overlapping "101" sequences in 32-bit input. Thus, "10101" counts as only a single occurrence, and "101101" counts as two occurrences. So, the maximum number of such patterns will occur when "101101" is repeated, which comes out to be 10 in a 32-bit number. 10 can be represented by a 4-bit number.

| **Figure 1: Design representation** |
One of the solutions, of course is to make a truth-table and then find a solution using logic equation solving. But the number of combinations possible here is huge and practically impossible to find a solution. So, we need to follow a modular approach here.
We can divide the problem into two parts, detecting the required pattern and then counting how many patterns actually were detected. We are introducing an intermediate 32-bit output, each bit (Nth bit) detecting if the pattern was found with Nth bit of input as the middle symbol of pattern. To detect non-overlapping "101" pattern, we need to look into 2 bits on each side, thereby making a combinational logic comprising of 7 bits. There will be special cases for terminal bits (here bit-0, bit-1, bit-30 and bit-31) where we know that there are less than 2 bits on one side. So, we need to have special logic for these bits.
The overall combinational logic will look like as shown in figure below. Int-N (Nth bit of intermediate output) is a resultant of (Bit-N-3 to Bit-N+3). The number of 1's in the intermediate output will tell how many patterns were detected, which, as discussed earlier, will be maximum 10.

| **Figure 2: Block diagram representation of design** |
Let us, now, proceed for a generic logic for Nth intermediate output. As discussed, Nth output (On) depends upon 7 bits, 3 bits on the up and 3 on down. The Nth bit of output will show "1"only for following cases: X1101XX & 00101XX. As 10101XX will be detected as "1" for N+2 bit of output. If we denote the variables involved as G,F,E,D,C,A, then the output expression becomes
> On = FED'C + G'F'ED'C
> On = ED'C (F+G')
For bit 31, the upper two bits do not exist. 101XX is the expression for getting output as 1. Thus, the equation, on a similar note, can be expressed as:
> O31 = ED'C
For bit 30, the expression comes out to be X101XX. So, O30 also has same logic as O31.
For O1 and O0, we get the same expression as we get for On. The logic diagram for obtaining intermediate outputs is shown in figure 3 below:

| **Figure 3: Circuit with logic for intermediate output** |
Now, we have got the intermediate outputs showing which bits have the specified pattern detected. The number of "1"in the final output is our final answer. So, we need a special circuit to count the number of 1's combinationally in a bus as shown in figure 3 above. " [Combinationally count number of 1's in a bus](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/03/design-query-combinationally-count.html)" explains how we can do this.

### 20. Design query :: Combinationally count number of 1's in a 32-bit bus

**Date:** 2020-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/03/design-query-combinationally-count.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/03/design-query-combinationally-count.html)

### Design query :: Combinationally count number of 1's in a 32-bit bus
Solution: The design in question is a combinational design with 32-bit input and 6-bit output as there can be maximum 32 1's and 32 stands "100000" in binary. Making a truth-table or K-map for this problem is not practical, so we have to take a modular approach. Let us divide the problem into detecting number of 1's among 4 bits and then adding the resulting numbers together providing the total count.
Let us first create a truth-table converting the number of 1's in a 4-bit stream into a 2-bit number. The resulting truth table is shown in figure 1.

| **Figure 1: Truth table for 4-bit count 1's circuit** |
Solving the above for O2, O1 and O0 using K-maps, we get the expressions as shown in figures 2, 3 and 4 below.

| **Figure 4: Expression for O0** |
Thus, we have 8 instances, each counting the number of ones pertaining to respective 4 bits. The next thing we need is to add these 8 three-bit numbers to obtain the resultant total number of 1's in the 32-bit number we got. For this, we can again follow modular approach to add two numbers at a time until we are left with a single number. The block diagram of the complete solution is shown below in figure 5.

Hi
In the modular approach we took, I dont think that more optimal design could be used. Otherwise, of course, yes. We could write an RTL code for the whole design and let synthesis tool optimize the design. For a human, I dont think it is feasible.

### On chip bus power reduction techniques
The
process of data transmission on an on-chip bus leads to switching activity on
the bus wires, which charges and discharges the capacitance associated with the
wires and consequently leads to dynamic power dissipation.
Bus
encoding is widely used technique to reduce dynamic switching power. For any
encoding scheme the sender encoder encodes the signal, while receiver decoder
decodes the signal with inverse function. The power reduction encoding
techniques can be divided into 2 categories: a) self-switching power reduction
b) coupling power reduction.
Self-switching
is bit toggling between 0 and 1 level on a wire over time, causing this wire
capacitance charging and discharging with respect to its metal layer. Following
techniques are used to address this power dissipation:
1.Address bus encoding. It exploits
the high regularity associated with address streams, which is characterized by
local and temporal locality.
a.Gray code encoding. This scheme
guarantees only bit flip in case of sequential addresses access.
b.T0 code. It uses an extra signal on
bus which indicates whether the currently accessed address is the sequential of
the previously accessed. If yes, the address bus isn’t toggled, and the
receiver is responsible to calculate the address based on the previous.
c.T0-C code. Here the extra signal is
eliminated and instead a new address is sent to indicate the address regularity
finished.
2.Data bus encoding. Data bus on the
contrary to address bus doesn’t possess any regularity but rather can be
considered random. Therefore, no local and temporal locality can be effectively
exploited.
a.Bus-invert code. It uses Hamming
distance (the number of changed bits) computation between the current value and
the next value on the bus and inverts the value if the distance is greater than
half of the bit width. An additional indication signal is used to indicate the
value is inverted.
b.Transition signaling. In this scheme
logical 1 is indicated by level transition from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0, while
logical 0 doesn’t cause transition. This scheme ensures the number of
transitions on bus is equal to the number of 1s and is effective with data
where the number of 1s is less than the number of 0s.
Coupling
power is dissipated when crosstalk between different wires of the bus happens.
Following techniques are used to address this power dissipation:
1.Address bus encoding.
a.Permutation of address bus lines is
done at physical design stage to reduce coupling. It can be achieved by
orthogonal layout of the wires or passing them through different metal layers.
2.Data bus encoding.
a.CBI (coupling bus-invert). Is very
similar to previously explained bus-invert code scheme but inverts the data to
achieve better cross-coupling effect.
b.Transition pattern coding scheme
(TPC). It adds signal to the bus to encode codeword patterns in which
neighboring lines change in phase.

### 1. Metastability tolerant designs

**Date:** 2019-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/11/metastability-tolerant-designs.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/11/metastability-tolerant-designs.html)

### Metastability tolerant designs
We discussed, in our posts [metastability](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/09/metastability.html) and [how a flip-flop goes metastable](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/10/how-latchflip-flop-goes-metastable.html), the basics of metastability and what causes metastability failures in designs. We also discussed the impacts of metastability failures in our designs. So, we are bound to think of ways of preventing metastability in designs. The only way to do so is not to let the input toggle during setup-hold window. This can be done if we have completely synchronous designs and setup-hold timing is met for all timing paths. But, every design is bound to have asynchronous signals as everything in this world cannot run on a single clock. For example, when you press reset button on a device, this has to be an asynchronous event since the event is generated by your body, which runs on a different clock than the device. :-)
Thus, in reality, we cannot prevent metastability. We can only reduce its existence or make our designs such that the occurence of metastability does not affect the state machine.
- **Avoid metastability to as much extent as possible**: As discussed earlier, we can try to make the designs as such synchronous as possible. Thus, by virtue of setup-hold requirements being met, metastability will not be much of an issue. Another possible solution is to decrease the frequency of system. Less number of clock edges will mean less probability of data being captured during setup/hold window. However, do we really want to limit our designs' performance just for the sake of metastability? So, we must make our designs metastability tolerant.
- **Make our designs metastability tolerant to as much extent as possible**: The most common way to make designs metastability tolerant is to add synchronizer stages. Doing this, we are allowing certain flip-flops in the design to go metastable, but not allowing their metastability to impact the design by propagating to later stages. However, this also does not guarantee perfect immunity to design failures, but reduces the occurent of design failures due to metastability to almost nil, if carefully designed.

### 2. Asynchronous FIFO

**Date:** 2019-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/11/asynchronous-fifo.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/11/asynchronous-fifo.html)

### Asynchronous FIFO
ASYNC
FIFO is a frequency relationship agnostic bus synchronization technique and by
that can be considered practically universal.
It
is convenient to choose the write/read pointers of width by one bit bigger than
needed by FIFO size. The msb then will play the role of “sign”. The pointers
(bus) synchronization is performed with the help of Gray encoding. Gray code
encoding is a popular technique to synchronize a bus because only one bit is
changed at a time. This ensures we always sample or old or new value on the bus
and never – inconsistent one. “g2b” and “b2g” is the logic to convert Gray code
to binary and vice versa. It is out of the scope of this article to depict its
design.

//write pointer
always @ (src\_clk)
if (!rst\_n)
wr\_ptr
<= ‘d0;
else if (push)
wr\_ptr
<= wr\_ptr + 1’b1;
//read pointer
always @ (dst\_clk)
if (!rst\_n)
rd\_ptr
<= ‘d0;
else if (pop)
rd\_ptr
<= rd\_ptr + 1’b1;
//full
assign full = (wr\_ptr\[log(FIFO\_SIZE)\] ^
rd\_ptr\_synch\[log(FIFO\_SIZE)\]) &&
(wr\_ptr\[log(FIFO\_SIZE)-1:0\] ==
rd\_ptr\_synch\[log(FIFO\_SIZE)-1:0\]);
//empty
assign empty = (wr\_ptr\_synch\[log(FIFO\_SIZE):0\] ==
rd\_ptr\[log(FIFO\_SIZE):0\]);
The
important thing to remember is the size of the FIFO has to be exactly power
of two. This is because in any other case there will be multiple bit
transitions even with Gray code encoding and thus bus synchronization with only
one bit changed at a time is violated.

You need handshaking on the pointers. Otherwise the slow clock may see two consecutive increments, which defeats the purpose of gray code.

### 3. How a latch/flip-flop goes metastable

**Date:** 2019-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/10/how-latchflip-flop-goes-metastable.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/10/how-latchflip-flop-goes-metastable.html)

### How a latch/flip-flop goes metastable
In the post metastability, we discussed that inverter loop can be put into a meta-stable state. Since, latches and flip-flops consist of inverter loops controlled by transmission gates, they also are susceptible to meta-stability. For instance, consider a negative latch as shown in figure 1 and the clock waveform alongside. The instance of interest to us is the instance when switch\_1 closes or at the transparency\_close edge of the latch. Also, we know from theory two important concepts, "setup time" and "hold time". Let us call the region between setup time and hold time as setup-hold-window. If the data toggles before setup-hold-window, it is guaranteed to get captured and propagated to latch output. If data toggles after setup-hold-window, it is guaranteed not to get propagated to latch output. On the other hand, if it toggles during setup-hold-window, it may or may not propagate to the output. Also, it may happen that when the switch closes, the input level is such that latch goes into metastable state.

| **Figure 1: How latch goes into metastable state** |
As is evident from figure 1, input is still transitioning when switch has closed and the output goes metastable.
Similarly, as a flip-flop is also composed of latches configured in master-slave configuration, a flip-flop also goes metastable by same way. In general, we can describe it as:
A flip-flop/latch has a defined timing requirement in terms of when data should be available at its input so that it is correctly captured. These requirements are termed as setup and hold times. If these requirements are not met, there is a possibility of flip-flop going metastable.
In general, following are the scenarios which can cause a flip-flop's output to go metastable.
- **Asynchronous timing paths**: Paths crossing clock domains, where the launch and capture clocks do not have definite phase relationship, cannot be assured to be captured outside setup/hold window.
- If there is a timing path violating setup and/or hold, then the capturing flip-flop will go metastable at a certain PVT, where it is probable to get captured in setup-hold-window
**How metastability impacts design**:  Let us assume that the output of flip-flop goes to a number of gates (say 100). So, as long as the flip-flop is in metastable range, it will cause short circuit current to flow in all the gates. [This link](https://courseware.ee.calpoly.edu/~dbraun/courses/ee307/F02/02_Shelley/Section2_BasilShelley.htm) shows the short circuit current to be in the range of 100 uA. So, large amount of short circuit current will flow for a considerable amount of time.
**What helps a flip-flop come out of metastability?**
As described earlier, theoretically, it is possible for the flip-flop to remain in metastable state for infinite time in the absense of any disturbance. However, there are certain factors, which help it to come out of metastability.
- **Ability of the inverter pair to detect a disturbance and act on it**: If the inverter pair is able to detect even a smallest of the disturbances, it will act upon it and eventually come out of metastability. So, having these characteristics for transistors in inverter pair will help:
  - Low VT
  - High drive strength
- Higher the time available for metastability resolution, more chances of having disturbance; hence, flip-flop will eventuall come out of metastability
In general, the ability of a flip-flop to come out of metastability is measured by a parameter known as MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures). It can be thought of as inverse of failure rate. Higher the MTBF, higher the probability of flip-flop coming out of metastability within a given time. It depends upon:
- Technology factors
- Time available to resolve metastability: Higher the time available, higher is MTBF
- Frequency of the clock received by flip-flop: Higher the frequency of clock, lower is MTBF
- Frequency of toggling of data received by flip-flop: Higher is frequency of data, lower is MTBF
- Internal design of flip-flop: Ability of flip-flop to act on smallest of disturbances, as discussed earlier. In general, a flip-flop consuming more power and having high gain will be able to come out of metastability quickly

### 4. Half-handshake synchronization scheme

**Date:** 2019-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/10/half-handshake-synchronization-scheme.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/10/half-handshake-synchronization-scheme.html)

### Half-handshake synchronization scheme
Synchronization questions is one of the favorites among VLSI job interviewers. This is because they check not just the general intellectual abilities of the potential candidate but also the very specific professional knowledge which is usually acquired only by experience. When it comes to synchronization there are plenty of schemes. During the emerging interview it often comes to the "ultimate" decision - the synchronizer, which is tolerable to any source-destination conditions (relative frequencies, duration of signals, etc). The expected answer is very well known full-handshake scheme. It is definitely the "ultimate" solution. But its extra-generic nature comes at a cost of very long processing cycle (6 source + 6 destination cycles).
Less known is half hand-shake synchronization scheme which differs from full hand-shake scheme by that it utilizes signals toggling rather than level as an indication to transfer synchronization information from side to side.

At source and destination sides it is toggling (0 to 1 signal change or vice versa) of the synchronized valid signal or ack signal, which becomes an indication the synchronized output may be issued and/or the state changed. Toggled signal may be achieved by comparison (XOR) of the next and current signal value. The current signal value need to be latched at each processing cycle.
Half-handshake scheme provides 2 times better processing cycle than full hand-shake because it consists of only synchronization-acknowledge cycle rather than of synchronization-acknowledge-synchronization de-assertion-acknowledge de-assertion.

### 5. Metastability

**Date:** 2019-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/09/metastability.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/09/metastability.html)

### Metastability
**What is metastability**: Literally speaking, metastable state refers to a state " **which is not so much stable**" and a slight disturbance will cause the system to lose state. In the context of VLSI, specifically sequential design, in addition to two stable states "0" and "1", there is also a state in-between at which the output may wander for some time due to inherent feedback design of a latch. This state is known as meta-stable state and the phenomenon is known as metastability. In order to understand this, let us study two back-to-back connected inverters as shown in figure below.
|     |

| **Figure 1: Inverter loop schematic** |
When the output (N2) of top inverter is 1, M4 & M1 are on. Simlilary, when output is 0, M3 & M2 are on. If the voltage of output inverter is left at anything other than VDD or GND, M4 and M1 try to pull the output towards 1 and the other two pull it towards 0. The final settlement value (either 0 or 1) is dependent upon whose initial pull is stronger. However, if the initial pull combined of M4 & M1 is equal to M3 & M1, the output will not move. The output may or may not remain at this level for some time until equilibrium is maintained. However, if forcefully, we change the output by even a small value, it will settle at 0 or 1 depending upon the direction of forced change. This state is the so-called metastable state. The inverter pair can remain in this state as long as there is no disturbance in the voltage levels. This disturbance can be due to external factors such as external forced voltage or internal factors such as crosstalk. So, if it is left to come out of metastability by itself, the time to come out of metastability is unknown. It depends upon:
- The value of voltage stimulus: If the level of disturbance is greater than a certain threshold, the output will start to move towards one of the stable levels. Of course, larger the value of initial disturbance, faster will be time to stability
- Strengths of inverters to pull towards "0" and "1": The less voltage resolution capability the inverter pair has, it will be able to come of metastability in shorter time

### 6. How can we generate a pulse for every edge of the incoming pulse

**Date:** 2019-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/09/how-can-we-generate-pulse-for-every.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/09/how-can-we-generate-pulse-for-every.html)

### How can we generate a pulse for every edge of the incoming pulse
> It is a very common requirement to detect either positive edge, negative edge or both edges of a signal. And the circuit that can detect and generate a single cycle pulse is quite simple. In this post, we will discuss how we can detect positive edge, negative edge and both edges of a signal.
- Detect positive edge of a signal: Positive edge of a signal means that the current state of the signal is "1" and previous state is "0". And a pulse signal means that the output of the circuit is "1" for one cycle. So, we need a circuit which generates "1" as output when present state is "1" and previous state is "0". It generates "0" as output otherwise.
> Thus, output = D(n-2)' & D(n-1)
> The required implementation is shown in figure 1 below:
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhT0eDmoK6uBcbrbXN3sbth40_N2LVVeZW578YLdxa6q5yuEhjmxsV6jhy69RQafxjxbN_S3QoXe8P4uCVF5-7BykAWFimhZUXv1MAyydUWMvfYKoDEDo-gPiH0zh_ymT27fO21sCdRnKzp/s640/Picture1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhT0eDmoK6uBcbrbXN3sbth40_N2LVVeZW578YLdxa6q5yuEhjmxsV6jhy69RQafxjxbN_S3QoXe8P4uCVF5-7BykAWFimhZUXv1MAyydUWMvfYKoDEDo-gPiH0zh_ymT27fO21sCdRnKzp/s1600/Picture1.png) |
| **Figure 1: Detection of positive edge of signal** |
- Detect negative edge of a signal: Negative edge of signal means that the current state of the signal is "0" and previous state is "0". So, we need a circuit which generates "1" as output when present state is "0" and previous state is "1". It generates "0" as output otherwise.
> Thus, Neg\_edge\_detect = D(n-2) & D(n-1)'
> The required implementation is shown in figure 2 below:
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLFLW8Qqwvzg03pmNDp1Btqbj_WGNWl96VAP7LJGfHICVdj57INZW6OWwVvTfuWBEGM5Zjx9RelmRLwmpNrtqxqF7maJqqsa_PYDCwkjL2Z5slPsW3mjTp0JRZgff0IPvTKlLn4yLHfnug/s640/Picture2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLFLW8Qqwvzg03pmNDp1Btqbj_WGNWl96VAP7LJGfHICVdj57INZW6OWwVvTfuWBEGM5Zjx9RelmRLwmpNrtqxqF7maJqqsa_PYDCwkjL2Z5slPsW3mjTp0JRZgff0IPvTKlLn4yLHfnug/s1600/Picture2.png) |
| **Figure 2: Detection of negative edge of signal** |
- Detecting both positive and negative edges of the signal: Simply doing an "OR" operation of Pos\_edge\_detect and Neg\_edge\_detect signal will produce an output which is a single cycle pulse for any of the edge of incoming signal. The requirement for consecutive edges of incoming signal is to be at least 2 cycles apart otherwise, the output will not be pulse, but will be a continuous signal.
> Any\_edge\_detect = Pos\_edge\_detect + Neg\_edge\_detect
> The required implementation is shown in figure 3 below:
|     |

| **Figure 3: Detection of both positive and negative edges of signal** |
> The technique we discussed here delays the output by two cycles. Can you think of any other way to detect the edges of a signal which is more efficient?

### 9. Does it make sense to check hold violations at synthesis stage

**Date:** 2019-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/07/does-it-make-sense-to-check-hold.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/07/does-it-make-sense-to-check-hold.html)

### Does it make sense to check hold violations at synthesis stage
As we know from basics of STA, hold timing equation is generally of the form:
> **Hold\_slack = Data\_path\_delay - hold\_time\_of\_flop - clock\_skew**
Which can be re-organized as follows:
> **Hold\_slack = Data\_path\_delay + launch\_clock\_delay - capture\_clock\_delay - hold\_time\_of\_flop**
Data\_path\_delay + launch\_clock\_delay may be combined to represent arrival of data at the capture flip-flop with respect to clock source. The same is evident from below figure.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5Zpni55Dt2hNcRAGUvRhkDeom3cZMAFCANa7HzzdEKHprfTxeKW1p5MX3I-mAkcj-0aJ2utia9sNuh9G2Uq6gN11nAFMRAhpsotyrAGHYcPBuj19f8Whx770650MSJzATqwaxQnlzKq2T/s640/Picture1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5Zpni55Dt2hNcRAGUvRhkDeom3cZMAFCANa7HzzdEKHprfTxeKW1p5MX3I-mAkcj-0aJ2utia9sNuh9G2Uq6gN11nAFMRAhpsotyrAGHYcPBuj19f8Whx770650MSJzATqwaxQnlzKq2T/s1600/Picture1.png)
The modified equation, then, becomes:
> **Hold\_slack = Data\_arrival\_at\_capture\_flop - Clock\_arrival\_at\_capture\_flop - hold\_time\_of\_flop**
It is clear from above equation that hold checks generally comprise of a race condition between clock and data minus a fixed number (is hold\_time\_of\_flop really a fixed number is a separate question).
Before clock-tree synthesis, we do not have one major aspect of this equation; i.e. we do not know the arrival times of clock at launch and capture flip-flops. Also, we do not know how much is the skew and uncommon clock path contributing to on-chip variations; thus, requiring extra margin for hold slack. Talking about logic synthesis, we do not even have placement data most of the times, so we do not even have correct data path delay estimates with us. So, fixing hold at synthesis will not help as there will anyways be requirement for hold fixes taking into account actual data and clock path delays.
But the most important reason for not fixing hold before clock-tree synthesis is that the task of hold fixing is not much complex for the tools available. It may be as simple as downsizing logic and/or adding buffers in data path where setup slack is available. So, during synthesis and logic placement, tools focus on getting setup targets met and focus on hold after clock tree is built.
Another point to note is that after data nets routing, data path delay may increase because of detouring of data nets as compared to originally estimated. So, it may be wise not to fix hold violations of very small magnitude even after clock-tree synthesis and wait for data nets routing to see how many of those violations are still there.

### 10. Duty cycle care-abouts for clock paths in reset assertion

**Date:** 2019-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/06/duty-cycle-care-abouts-for-clock-paths.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/06/duty-cycle-care-abouts-for-clock-paths.html)

### Duty cycle care-abouts for clock paths in reset assertion
In the post [Asynchronous reset assertion timing scenarios](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/06/asynchronous-reset-assertion-timing.html), we discussed how we may need to time the assertion of asynchronous reset as well. In this post, we will talk about how important it is to talk about the duty cycle aspect as well. We will use the same example as we did in our previous post to help make a better connection.
In the figure below (discussed in [Asynchronous reset assertion timing scenarios](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/06/asynchronous-reset-assertion-timing.html)), Q0 goes from 0 ->1 and 1 -> 0 in the same cycle, thereby providing a very diminished high pulse, or very diminished low pulse to **BIT\_1** flip-flop depending upon the delay in reset path of **BIT\_0** flip-flop. This can result in violation of minimum pulse width requirement of **BIT\_1.** We will discuss this in some detail in this post.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEix9AC2YmM4WFnRgDxSUi2ni7OS_EIXLZisUtUmEBVglqX6qh0ppvY28UDrjFYWLF0fO2T5xcnXfXEr3UXmIcRnJo0hK1tPHdtKuDwDLFcTJvX0Hw40B4uxpVUlc8_79CJiDfMpQOD0kv7H/s640/Picture1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEix9AC2YmM4WFnRgDxSUi2ni7OS_EIXLZisUtUmEBVglqX6qh0ppvY28UDrjFYWLF0fO2T5xcnXfXEr3UXmIcRnJo0hK1tPHdtKuDwDLFcTJvX0Hw40B4uxpVUlc8_79CJiDfMpQOD0kv7H/s1600/Picture1.png)
Let us talk only about clock edge number 4. **Q0** goes 1 and **BIT\_1** receives it as positive edge of clock, thereby changing state too. The delay till **BIT\_1** receiving positive edge of clock is given as
POS\_CK\_AT\_BIT\_1 = (Latency of BIT\_0) + (CLK->Q of BIT\_0) + (BIT\_0/Q -> BIT\_1/CK)
Now, both Q0 and Q1 go 1, thereby causing the output of NAND gate going "0", which asserts the reset of both BIT\_0 and BIT\_1. BIT\_1 now receives negative edge of clock, whose delay is
NEG\_CK\_AT\_BIT\_1 = (Latency of BIT\_0) + (CLK->Q of BIT\_0) + NAND\_DELAY + (R -> Q of BIT\_0) +   (BIT\_0/Q -> BIT\_1/CK)
The width of high pulse that the flip-flop receives is equal to the difference between above two values:
HIGH\_PULSE\_WIDTH\_AT\_BIT\_1 = NAND\_DELAY + (R -> Q of BIT\_0)
And low pulse is equal to
LOW\_PULSE\_WIDTH\_AT\_BIT\_1 = CLK\_PERIOD - HIGH\_PULSE\_WIDTH\_AT\_BIT\_1
Now, depending upon the combinational delays mentioned as well as CLK\_PERIOD, BIT\_1 may receive a pulse (either high or low) with width less than what is permissible for its proper functionality. Thus, there will be a pulse width violation.
Looking at the equations for high and low pulse widths, it seems more probable to have high pulse width violating for BIT\_1, unless either clock period is very less or buffering is there in reset path of BIT\_0. We will need to increase buffering to reset pin of BIT\_0 to increase width of high pulse and vice-versa.
The discussion we just had is applicable to any design in particular with reset controlling a signal driving another flip-flop's CK pin. However, one may argue following about this particular circuit:
**This particular circuit is resistant to high pulse width violation, but may have low pulse width violations**.
Can you argue in favor/against this statement? What is the reason for one making this statement. (Hint: Answer lies in the sequence of events causing CK to BIT\_1 to go high and then go low).

I have a doubt. There will be reset assertion when both inputs of nand gate will become 1. But in article, you have considered that when Bit0 output goes high, reset will be asserted (in equation of neg clk egde at Bit1). Do we have to consider output of Bit1 to also go high and consider clk to Q delay of that in equation,???

### 11. Asynchronous reset assertion timing scenarios

**Date:** 2019-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/06/asynchronous-reset-assertion-timing.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/06/asynchronous-reset-assertion-timing.html)

### Asynchronous reset assertion timing scenarios
We have always heard that for asynchronous resets, only de-assertion needs to be timed. This is true for most of the designs as the guidelines followed for implementation of asynchronous resets. However, there may be a  scenario wherein we may need to consider reset assertion as well for our timing checks. In this post, we will try to put some light on it.
In our post " [recovery and removal checks](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/04/recovery-and-removal-checks.html)", we have elaborated following for asynchronous resets:
\\* Reset assertion "combinationally" causes the output to go 0; i.e., assertion of reset does not wait for edge of the clock to alter the state of flip-flop
\\* Reset de-assertion waits for clock edge to propagate the value at "input" to "output". There are checks corresponding to de-assertion of reset with respect to clock known as "recovery" and "removal" checks.
Thus, we see that "recovery" and "removal" checks are defined only for de-assertion of asynchronous reset. So, one must think that there is no timing requirement for reset assertion. This is true in the sense that there is no requirement for reset assertion at the flip-flop that is receiving reset. And overall no timing requirement for a carefully implemented design. But some-times, there may be a corner-case scenario requiring the combinational path throuhg "reset -> output" to be timed. We will discuss some cases to elaborate our statement.
**CASE 1:** The output of flip-flop goes to another flip-flop, which itself is getting reset at the same time.
Here, since, the output in fanout is itself in reset state, it will not be sampling the output. Hence, there is no need to time the assertion of reset.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEic0jbxXauFdOKyNIptru4broW7yZLvEoGxulDJ-2_atsdeSga2u0EfRP1jvF4UiWVlJs6QArTOutxQIyOqJtUYFG63a-M7dMzcs4SexEpplPb7XgFGS1HZuAUNsBiglqKVUwDO1mbIGSQm/s640/Picture1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEic0jbxXauFdOKyNIptru4broW7yZLvEoGxulDJ-2_atsdeSga2u0EfRP1jvF4UiWVlJs6QArTOutxQIyOqJtUYFG63a-M7dMzcs4SexEpplPb7XgFGS1HZuAUNsBiglqKVUwDO1mbIGSQm/s1600/Picture1.png)
**CASE 2:** The output of flip-flop goes to an asynchronous domain or to a synchronizer which is not, itself, in reset. Here, the asynchronous domain flip-flop is expected to be a synchronizer in most of the cases. So, there does not arise a need for meeting timing.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK5_Mh5RikFU7AlO7kgUpwyu1s9GmKLLIy9v3_KKuTqeGsqa5eC3DZpuZmuZWyYwjvbHPpXm-sqdjKTMTedxS3hmL-cjNLbMTzpgNd-VjAdVbeqcRJho8I-sYQsvosXKugvCfShKthwv-t/s640/Picture2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK5_Mh5RikFU7AlO7kgUpwyu1s9GmKLLIy9v3_KKuTqeGsqa5eC3DZpuZmuZWyYwjvbHPpXm-sqdjKTMTedxS3hmL-cjNLbMTzpgNd-VjAdVbeqcRJho8I-sYQsvosXKugvCfShKthwv-t/s1600/Picture2.png)
**CASE 3:** The output of flip-flop goes to a flip-flop which is working on a synchronous clock and is expecting synchronous data. In this case, we will have to meet timing through the R -> Q of the source flip-flop and getting captured at the destination. We need to keep in mind that reset synchronizer also transfers through R -> Q for reset assertion. So, this case cannot be valid for global asynchronous reset assertion. For instance, let us consider below as a valid scenario.
For below case, we have to meet reset assertion timing from
ASYNC\_RESET\_SOURCE -> REG\_B/R -> REG\_B/Q -> REG\_C/R -> REG\_C/Q -> REG\_D/D
Since, reset source is working on asynchronous clock, this is a design violation to get it captured on a flip-flop which is running functionally and expecting synchronous data.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhANBMGyJkD-J_B5EeclkDDNBKlXyw6LGKZqpJWBy7OLqKJDlpG1fd8M0-qx7M6LGcSf91CAVc97AZ2PndT4tRIRlHbtQTMeobw8RxUzt5RmxExqIjEquGNdW3V_YVOwmjK59RwE98BO5f9/s640/Picture4.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhANBMGyJkD-J_B5EeclkDDNBKlXyw6LGKZqpJWBy7OLqKJDlpG1fd8M0-qx7M6LGcSf91CAVc97AZ2PndT4tRIRlHbtQTMeobw8RxUzt5RmxExqIjEquGNdW3V_YVOwmjK59RwE98BO5f9/s1600/Picture4.png)
Thus, there may not be any scenario to time asynchronous reset assertion globally. However, the state machines may locally utilize asynchronous reset assertion to get things done. For instance, you must have gone through a common problem known as " [conversion of asynchronous counter to decade counter](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/counter/count_2.html)", wherein asynchronous reset pin is utilized to reset the count whenever count reaches 10. We will simplify it as "conversion of 2-bit asynchronous counter to modulo-3 counter" to serve our purpose.
Consider following design of 2-bit asynchronous counter. We have shown two flip-flops to register the output of this counter for illustration purposes and to make the understanding more clear. Flip-flop "BIT\_1" gets the output of "BIT\_0" as clock. All other flip-flops get CLK as clock. Whenever output of both "BIT\_1" and "BIT\_0" goes 1, the reset of both flops will cause output to go "00" in the same cycle. This is expected to reach the registers by next clock cycle so that it can be captured properly. The intermediate state "11" is not captured at the next stage as understood by basics of state machines.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5xJjl4t26WhVM8H4Vn4nyJXHe6R4Nvm3tBsZMZBDwgczzpgd8_uQIhe_2eUtoxCJfSLtjUNOvf7C_2m3OFUmmpknEY7VW_re0xwNK69UoricmPsj4oap3EEZ8jdcKrGCmEQFIYLboHGcq/s640/Picture2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5xJjl4t26WhVM8H4Vn4nyJXHe6R4Nvm3tBsZMZBDwgczzpgd8_uQIhe_2eUtoxCJfSLtjUNOvf7C_2m3OFUmmpknEY7VW_re0xwNK69UoricmPsj4oap3EEZ8jdcKrGCmEQFIYLboHGcq/s1600/Picture2.png)
We get following timing equations to be met in a single cycle (minus setup time and skews etc.).
BIT\_1/CK -> BIT\_1/Q -> BIT\_1/R -> BIT\_1/Q -> REG\_1/D
BIT\_1/CK -> BIT\_1/Q -> BIT\_0/R -> BIT\_0/Q -> REG\_0/D
BIT\_0/CK -> BIT\_0/Q -> BIT\_1/R -> BIT\_1/Q -> REG\_1/D
BIT\_0/CK -> BIT\_0/Q -> BIT\_0/R -> BIT\_0/Q -> REG\_0/D
Thus, this is an example of a scenario wherein we need timing for assertion of reset as well. It is captured at the next flip-flops running combinationally through the flip-flops' "Q" pin. Can you deduce the timing paths to be timed for the original case of "asynchronous counter as a decade counter" as well.
Another possible care-about of asynchronous reset assertion may be degradation of duty cycle, if the output is used as a clock such as highlighted path, where Q0 is being consumed as clock for "BIT\_1" flip-flop. This can cause the minimum pulse width requirement to be violated for "BIT\_1" flip-flop. This perspective of reset assertion is discussed [here](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/06/duty-cycle-for-clock-paths-in-reset.html).

### 12. 4:1 mux as universal gate

**Date:** 2019-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/06/41-mux-as-universal-gate.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/06/41-mux-as-universal-gate.html)

### 4:1 mux as universal gate
A universal gate is a gate which can implement any given logic function. **NAND** and **NOR** gates are basically known as universal gates, since you can implement any logic function with these. A multiplexer, in a sense, can also be termed as a universal gate, since, you can realize any function by using a mux as a look-up-table structure. In this post, we discuss how we can utilize a 4:1 mux as a universal gate realizing 2-input gates.
Any two-input gate gives a definite value (either 0 or 1) for all the combinations of its inputs and can be represented in the form of truth table as shown in table below.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQqDNH9IfmmUkGtiRJ7k3-CNAshW4VhvhRw5vFXZC1XjIDWxUnLE3tgNRfUxzFRTJzFu1DFIxMnpXWaeBk6RmQ6EDczndbv8gLGpCWIAg_r80tTpHa6CrYt4dj4-F7FvETx-gZzcyPdvPH/s640/Picture2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQqDNH9IfmmUkGtiRJ7k3-CNAshW4VhvhRw5vFXZC1XjIDWxUnLE3tgNRfUxzFRTJzFu1DFIxMnpXWaeBk6RmQ6EDczndbv8gLGpCWIAg_r80tTpHa6CrYt4dj4-F7FvETx-gZzcyPdvPH/s1600/Picture2.png)
Here, A,B,C & D can be either "0" or "1" depending upon the functionality of the gate. For instance, for a 2-input AND gate, A = B = C = 0 and D = 1.
Utilizing a 4-input mux for implementing this generic 2-input gate, we can implement as shown below:

For instance, 2-input AND gate will be implemented as following:

This looks like a decoder, not a mux

Hi
This is a mux only. The output is single bit, either "1" or "0". The output of encoder is multi-bit.

### 14. Can we use discrete latches and AND/OR gates instead of ICG?

**Date:** 2019-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/05/can-we-use-discrete-latches-and-andor.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/05/can-we-use-discrete-latches-and-andor.html)

### Can we use discrete latches and AND/OR gates instead of ICG?
In the post, [Integated Clock Gating Cell](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/integrated-clock-gating-cell.html), we discussed that an ICG has a negative level-sensitive latch preceding an AND gate in order to relax hold timing for clock gating check. And we discussed that it gives benefits for area, power and timing. Let us discuss how area, power and timing are saved. We will discuss only for the case of AND gate, the same will follow for OR gate.
1\. **Architectural benefits - simplicity in clock handling**: By introducing ICGs in place of discrete gates, you dont have to worry about the launch edge of the signal while writing RTL (for details, see [here](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/05/clock-switching-and-clock-gating-checks.html)). One can always launch the signal from positive edge-triggered flip-flop for timing and architectural simplicity without worrying about possibility of glitch in clock path due to wrong polarity flip-flop launching enable signal.
2\. **Benefits in area and power**: Having custom module allows for better utilization of resources inside the custom ICG module; hence, it is expected to have lesser power than a latch and an AND gate combined.
3\. **Benefits in timing:** Having the path from latch -> AND inside ICG saves us from having to meet these paths individually, which could take a lot of effort with discrete latch and AND gate. Also, it allows for latch to have almost full time borrow, thereby making almost a full cycle path from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop to ICG.

### 15. Design problem : Convert a multiplexer to priority mux (Logic restructuring for a multiplexer for timing critical paths)

**Date:** 2019-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/04/design-problem-convert-multiplexer-to.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/04/design-problem-convert-multiplexer-to.html)

### Design problem : Convert a multiplexer to priority mux (Logic restructuring for a multiplexer for timing critical paths)
**Problem statement: Given an 8:1 multiplexer such that the input connected to 5th input is the most setup timing critical and other inputs are timing critical in the order D0 > D1 > D2 > D3 > D4 > D6 > D7. Restructure the logic accordingly.**
**Solution:** We know that the most setup timing critical signal should have least logic in the data path. So, we need to prioritize 5th input such that it has least logic out of all the inputs. In other words, this is a problem of converting an ordinary multiplexer to a priority multiplexer. Let us first discuss how we can convert a multiplexer to priority mux.
Figure 1 below shows a multiplexer with 8-inputs D0 - D7 and selects S2,S1,S0.
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7nzkhDh4N-Ris_wPqlBV564ofCZh4g3JIUOnma-OhTGa-FFazucm15fVf2g2m7MDYtY3tdgoAEj-WctfD9_7OEHS4KhibzO6HfHK20IzAT7l43I8Y_KUlLOC5hdW8WpD3gvmdZ330J2-e/s640/Picture7.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7nzkhDh4N-Ris_wPqlBV564ofCZh4g3JIUOnma-OhTGa-FFazucm15fVf2g2m7MDYtY3tdgoAEj-WctfD9_7OEHS4KhibzO6HfHK20IzAT7l43I8Y_KUlLOC5hdW8WpD3gvmdZ330J2-e/s1600/Picture7.png) |
| **Figure 1: 8:1 multiplexer** |
The equation for output is given as below:
O = S2.S1.S0.D7 + S2.S1.S0’.D6 +
S2.S1’.S0.D5 + S2.S1’.S0’.D4 + S2’.S1.S0.D3 + S2’.S1.S0’.D2 + S2’.S1’.S0.D1 +
S2’.S1’.S0’.D0
This multiplexer can be represented in the form of a priority multiplexer as required is as shown in figure 2 below.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0Yrszm_CPzvraS0qcscPIYfj4kR1OnT8nMQYINJlH_TLWBe31AcObU06Qak3D_X1g9DhTIFRObFonbEM0jlJu3KLxvtaGtuVHUF1LHTdY3Q0UVypFF1H_AVKsNRX2dTct01JcH4bOqOto/s640/Picture5.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0Yrszm_CPzvraS0qcscPIYfj4kR1OnT8nMQYINJlH_TLWBe31AcObU06Qak3D_X1g9DhTIFRObFonbEM0jlJu3KLxvtaGtuVHUF1LHTdY3Q0UVypFF1H_AVKsNRX2dTct01JcH4bOqOto/s1600/Picture5.png)
We can start from the equation of the priority multiplexer and prove that it is actually equivalent to 8:1 mux.
The equation of the priority multiplexer is given as:
**O = (S0.S1'.S2).D5 + (S0.S1'.S2)'.(S0'.S1'.S2').D0 +****(S0.S1'.S2)'.(S0'.S1'.S2').** **(S0.S1'.S2').D1 +** **(S0.S1'.S2)'.(S0'.S1'.S2').** **(S0.S1'.S2')'.(S0'.S1.S2').D2           +** **(S0.S1'.S2)'.(S0'.S1'.S2').** **(S0.S1'.S2')'.(S0'.S1.S2')'.(S0.S1.S2').D3 +** **(S0.S1'.S2)'.(S0'.S1'.S2').** **(S0.S1'.S2')'.(S0'.S1.S2')'.(S0.S1.S2')'.(S0'.S1.S2).D4 +** **(S0.S1'.S2)'.(S0'.S1'.S2').** **(S0.S1'.S2')'.(S0'.S1.S2')'.(S0.S1.S2')'.(S0'.S1.S2)'.(S0'.S1.S2).D6 +** **(S0.S1'.S2)'.(S0'.S1'.S2').** **(S0.S1'.S2')'.(S0'.S1.S2')'.(S0.S1.S2')'.(S0'.S1.S2)'.(S0'.S1.S2)'.(S0.S1.S2).D7**
Simplifying the above equation leads us to the equation of ordinary multiplexer.

### 16. Priority multiplexer

**Date:** 2019-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/03/priority-multiplexer.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/03/priority-multiplexer.html)

### Priority multiplexer
Priority multiplexers are common in case one of the inputs is to be prioritized. The reason for this can be either functional or timing. In case of timing being the reason, the most setup timing critical input is connected to the highest priority input. The reason is that the highest priority signal gets the least logic in its path in a priority multiplexer as discussed below. The schematic for a 4-input priority mux is shown in figure 1 below:
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigdK9thh8O1YdXKJvcJRkRhBBErGFR-o1eLjx8bPeUzfnsgx_q7lpeuGhZh5DDpK60b9r5OBvI7UN82fRLMAr_syqSqahyphenhyphenL8dBkMaOqAbQKUiazzIKRZHzXNHJj6Q5PV4e1GoeivQRToBh/s640/Picture8.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigdK9thh8O1YdXKJvcJRkRhBBErGFR-o1eLjx8bPeUzfnsgx_q7lpeuGhZh5DDpK60b9r5OBvI7UN82fRLMAr_syqSqahyphenhyphenL8dBkMaOqAbQKUiazzIKRZHzXNHJj6Q5PV4e1GoeivQRToBh/s1600/Picture8.png)
In the above diagram, X0 has the highest priority; followed by X1, X2 and X3. A priority multiplexer selects the input if the corresponding select line is "1" and none of the select lines with with higher priority is "1". For example, if S0 is "1", X0 will be selected always. But if S2 is "1", X2 will be selected only if both S1 and S0 are "0".
The logic equation of a priority mux can be written as:
Y = S0.X0 + S0'.S1.X1 + S0'.S1'.S2 X2 + S0'.S1'.S2'.S3.X3 + S0'.S1'.S2'.S3'.S4.X4 + ......
Or, for a 4-input priority mux,
Y = S0.X0 + S0'.S1.X1 + S0'.S1'.S2 X2 + S0'.S1'.S2'.S3.X3
The output of the priority mux is not valid if all the select signals are "0", as we dont know which input to select in that case. That is why, figure 1 shows the D0 of the left multixer as don't care.
**How a priority mux differs from a normal mux**: In a normal mux, all the inputs have equal priorities, whereas they have different priorities in case of a priority mux.

### 17. Design problem: Design a circuit that delays the positive edge of a signal by one cycle

### Design problem: Design a circuit that delays the positive edge of a signal by one cycle
Here, we are given a problem wherein only ( 0 -> 1 ) transition of the signal is delayed by a single clock cycle whereas the other transition changes the output combination-ally. In other words, we are given the task to implement a Mealy state machine as output is both a function of state variables and input. However, this is a pretty simple problem involving single state. The output is a function of:
- Present input
- Input value one cycle before
Output should go "0" as soon as input goes "0". But it should go "1" when input one cycle back is "1". But there is a twist. What if current input is "0" and one cycle back, it was "1"? There is no clarity in the problem statement. Let us assume the output remains unchanged in such condition. The state transition table looks as shown below:

We can use K-map to solve for O. The solution is given in the figure below:

The resulting circuit is as shown in figure below.

Can you figure out the circuit that design that delays the negative edge of a signal by one cycle?

### 18. Design problem: How do you detect if two 8-bit numbers/signals are equal

**Date:** 2019-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/03/design-problem-how-do-you-detect-if-two.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/03/design-problem-how-do-you-detect-if-two.html)

### Design problem: How do you detect if two 8-bit numbers/signals are equal
Here, the problem involves detecting if each bit of a signal is equal to corresponding bit of the other signal and then generating a resultant. First of all, the circuit which provides equivalence of 1-bit is nothing but an XNOR gate as explained [here](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/03/single-bit-magnitude-comparator.html). So, we require 8 XNOR gates to judge equivalence of individual bits. Even if one of the bits is "0", it means the numbers are not equal, which can be obtained by ANDing the eight bits together.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgf5W2e8_jGZoc9YPHIzLmYjkIscseZ9d2DCgUPuHw5RjWog101G_5hJ9MxU61BLcBRgqafPgo05MiS0bgRqauyAfoMi_97OQS3dzOYaoYdN4uzgdDhuSjLFLw4gHVsirRDAlYdPxepIl-i/s640/8-bit+comparator+1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgf5W2e8_jGZoc9YPHIzLmYjkIscseZ9d2DCgUPuHw5RjWog101G_5hJ9MxU61BLcBRgqafPgo05MiS0bgRqauyAfoMi_97OQS3dzOYaoYdN4uzgdDhuSjLFLw4gHVsirRDAlYdPxepIl-i/s1600/8-bit+comparator+1.png)
Alternatively, we can use an XOR gate as well. An XOR gate provides output as "1" if the two inputs are not equal as explained [here](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/03/single-bit-magnitude-comparator.html). Even if one of the 8 individual XOR gates provides output as "1", it will mean that the numbers are not equal, which can be obtained by NORing the eight bits together.

Can you judge which of these can be implemented with less area and power?

Hi PJ
Yes, correct thinking, since AND Gate is involved there instead of NOR gate. But overall, it depends upon the implementation as well since internally you may find a way implement 8-input NOR gates with NMOS dominant logic as well. :-)

If any one output of the nor gate is 0 we need not check the other values. Thereby reducing power.

Hi
It doesn't work this way. The complete logic has to be always there. And will evaluate in real-time all the bits for equality.
Even if we assume that it can be done. The same argument that if any output of XOR gate is 1, we do not need to check for other values. So, this cannot be taken as an argument for one being better than the other in my opinion. We can discuss more. :-)

### 19. Single-bit magnitude comparator

**Date:** 2019-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/03/single-bit-magnitude-comparator.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/03/single-bit-magnitude-comparator.html)

### Single-bit magnitude comparator
A single-bit magnitude comparator compares between two single-bit values. There can be 4 possible cases for two single bit values A and B as follows:
- A = B
- A > B
- A < B
- A != B
The truth table showing each of the cases is shown in figure below:
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPE6HkFrjQgNV4XvS6pH-pttvTv_eYmC4cc9KZX5j9IoGoOGY5DkOEt2T2PKR27XHf5DM8I-ikv0EzuYQ_iOES_pFkjitbYnk5fPyXRn9r7C_6zI-D9_fMUW9Sf_BEsTTVCP_yP5f_I-vh/s640/1-bit+comparator+1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPE6HkFrjQgNV4XvS6pH-pttvTv_eYmC4cc9KZX5j9IoGoOGY5DkOEt2T2PKR27XHf5DM8I-ikv0EzuYQ_iOES_pFkjitbYnk5fPyXRn9r7C_6zI-D9_fMUW9Sf_BEsTTVCP_yP5f_I-vh/s1600/1-bit+comparator+1.png)
Let us use K-maps for deriving the logic for each of the four outputs as shown in figure below.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyZSLsUi_MiL3kaeq0Rs7yzO8bPrpipBjE2YW7Ou88JNWL3Nf7-nVL1Yk35r_ZdWpne3OtwWM3uD4h6aduigg73H0r2fciMCs4UqiEKqhkfcwY0aM2-Z2_jC-t8_OmYhH8Ql8h6ccbgsYo/s640/1-bit+comparator+2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyZSLsUi_MiL3kaeq0Rs7yzO8bPrpipBjE2YW7Ou88JNWL3Nf7-nVL1Yk35r_ZdWpne3OtwWM3uD4h6aduigg73H0r2fciMCs4UqiEKqhkfcwY0aM2-Z2_jC-t8_OmYhH8Ql8h6ccbgsYo/s1600/1-bit+comparator+2.png)
Thus, we get
> Equation of (A = B) : A (xnor) B
> Equation of (A < B) : A' B
> Equation of (A > B) : A B'
> Equation of (A != B) : A (xor) B

### 20. STA query : How positive edge trigger reg to positive latch path is zero cycle. But positive latch to rising flop is full cycle?

**Date:** 2019-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/03/sta-query-how-positive-edge-trigger-reg.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/03/sta-query-how-positive-edge-trigger-reg.html)

### STA query : How positive edge trigger reg to positive latch path is zero cycle. But positive latch to rising flop is full cycle?
Ever thought why it is expected for setup checks to be single cycle or zero cycle? Common sense prevails that the data launched at any instant is expected to be captured at the next available instant, forming a setup check. We will explain here with the help of an example of latch-to-reg and reg-to-latch path.
**Why setup check for postive latch to positive edge-triggered register is full cycle**: Figure 1 below shows the clock waveforms for a positive latch to positive edge-triggered flip-flop timing paths. Positive edge-triggered register samples data only on positive edges. In the below figure, those instances are either " **Time = 0**" or " **Time = T**". The output of latch can change anytime when it is transparent. The earliest it can change is at " **Time = 0+**". So, the next instant it can get captured at the register is " **Time = T**". This makes the default setup check for such paths. That is why setup check for positive latch to positive edge-triggered registers is full cycle.

| **Figure 1: Single cycle setup check from positive latch to positive edge-triggered flip-flop** |
**Why setup check for positive edge-triggered register to positive level-sensitive latch**: Similar to the above case, figure 2 shows the clock wave-forms for positive edge-triggered flip-flop to positive latch timing paths. The flip-flop can launch data at either " **Time = 0**" or " **Time = T**". So, data will be available at its output at either " **Time = 0+**" or " **Time = T+**". The latch can capture the data at the same instant as it launched as it is transparent at that time. So, setup check is considered to be zero cycle in this case.

| **Figure 2: Zero cycle setup check from positive edge-triggered flip-flop to positive latch** |
We need to note that the " **from**" and " **to**" edges in these checks denoted in text-books (or shown in timing reports by STA tools by default) are default setup and hold checks. The actual setup and hold check edges are what is represented by the state machine the timing path belongs to. It is possible to ovverride default check edges by command **set\_multicycle\_path**. I would recommend going through [setup and hold - the state machine essenstials](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/11/setuphold-state-machines-essentials.html) to have a deeper understanding of this concept. In other words, you could have made positive latch to positive edge-triggered flip-flop setup check as single cycle. But you would also have to modify the hold check in that case. Can you guess what it would be?

### 21. Design problem: Logic minimization and restructuring for timing critical paths

**Date:** 2019-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/03/design-problem-logic-minimization-and.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/03/design-problem-logic-minimization-and.html)

### Design problem: Logic minimization and restructuring for timing critical paths
**Problem statement: An 8:1 multiplexer selects one out of three inputs based upon different combinations of S2, S1 and S0 as shown in figure below. Minimize the logic with a view that B is the most timing critical input.**
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDhpf-DrTZyX0DHC5nvCQ6KvlXRFWFzTI95DwVnoqhYBOUBXKzg-xmnqcRRFAaNyojasxpPnWTBa5Nq6ZXBLq4mUWTxfPt9P4wwytMct5_DXQFpGu54FPKdKokiauRpRNyl67WyxKTIpvc/s640/logic+restructuring+-+1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDhpf-DrTZyX0DHC5nvCQ6KvlXRFWFzTI95DwVnoqhYBOUBXKzg-xmnqcRRFAaNyojasxpPnWTBa5Nq6ZXBLq4mUWTxfPt9P4wwytMct5_DXQFpGu54FPKdKokiauRpRNyl67WyxKTIpvc/s1600/logic+restructuring+-+1.png)
**Solution**:
A 4-input MUX has one 4-input AND and one 8-input OR between each input and the output. However, since, there is one signal connected to many of the inputs, there seems to be a scope of logic minimization. Let us use K-map to minimize the logic for problem. The K-map for this problem is as shown below:
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiv4Z4zIrWXAlyozy5DVDCLOet8egfnQOph9kpqEA7lZp4meBPSUlY-9fx9S68YU8-_vYV3w_iZSgsXFuCPozr51FMNag83ocGR5XSZt1fhzT3t_XVTLhY2137_hEN_cmpYhY_QyBZe6mBR/s320/logic+restructuring+-+2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiv4Z4zIrWXAlyozy5DVDCLOet8egfnQOph9kpqEA7lZp4meBPSUlY-9fx9S68YU8-_vYV3w_iZSgsXFuCPozr51FMNag83ocGR5XSZt1fhzT3t_XVTLhY2137_hEN_cmpYhY_QyBZe6mBR/s1600/logic+restructuring+-+2.png)
Writing the boolean expression, we get:
> **O = S2'S1'S0' C + S2'S1'S0 B + S1 C + S2S1'S0'A + S2S1'S0 C**
> **O = C (S1 + S1' (S2  ⊕  S0)) + S2'S1'S0 B + S2 S1' S0' A**
> **O = C (S1 + ( S2  ⊕  S0 )) + S2'S1'S0 B + S2 S1' S0' A   \[Using A + A'B = A + B\]**
If we analyze carefully, we see that **O** is obtained by **OR**-ing three terms; one for A, one for B and one for C. The resulting structure is shown below:
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9WGxXpddMfrP_vFjquBWQGKma2rmiD5WPL4KZ1ZIue2oldpaqhrNUzZo5i6NOo24TuG4UqMMyuaCgSZUxvVmlKHT8CvhG2oeOmiRq6v-Mdan00oDp5EKyCQ07D5lC9YXZVwK89jKB3aoj/s640/logic+restructuring+-+3.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9WGxXpddMfrP_vFjquBWQGKma2rmiD5WPL4KZ1ZIue2oldpaqhrNUzZo5i6NOo24TuG4UqMMyuaCgSZUxvVmlKHT8CvhG2oeOmiRq6v-Mdan00oDp5EKyCQ07D5lC9YXZVwK89jKB3aoj/s1600/logic+restructuring+-+3.png)
Since, **B** is the most timing-critical input; there should be minimum logic between **B** and output. In other words, it should be closest to output. In the above figure, we see that there is a 4-input AND gate and a 3-input OR gate between **O** and **B**. We can reduce the logic between B and O by breaking 3-input OR into 2-input OR gates such that **B** is closest to output. similarly, we can break the 4-input AND gate into 2-input and 3-input AND gates. Thus, we are left with one 2-input AND gate and one 2-input OR gate between **B** and **O** as shown in figure below.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgwunoK0LERI6Q-SavpxXu4bZIxro-NaBlQ96ZNIMtAFwkd2cSh27wyW_AWW6nDvnOZLjmevzt1Y78FYsZxdFZHO8APy3KIls1K_vio_gfRaz-M9TBsPvvUpCiEknrQ_eCZAxSN77tt1Lcz/s640/logic+restructuring+-+4.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgwunoK0LERI6Q-SavpxXu4bZIxro-NaBlQ96ZNIMtAFwkd2cSh27wyW_AWW6nDvnOZLjmevzt1Y78FYsZxdFZHO8APy3KIls1K_vio_gfRaz-M9TBsPvvUpCiEknrQ_eCZAxSN77tt1Lcz/s1600/logic+restructuring+-+4.png)
We see that there is still a possibility of logic re-structuring between **B** and **O**. De-Morgans theorem states that
> A + B = (A' B')'
Going by this, we can convert the OR gate at the output into NAND gate as shown in figure below.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjod9Ink1az1xI5agag87L0lRVLjEIrxUsa1iyeusfqQF78GkdD7-CHZSYEU7YoKBiKw8CtOFSb2yZl1vNHtLbdm-_rpEQGLlAoOweCqHGKac5ibO3W1WvWXXM8H41GAR0N04sr31nPvWA6/s640/logic+restructuring+-+5.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjod9Ink1az1xI5agag87L0lRVLjEIrxUsa1iyeusfqQF78GkdD7-CHZSYEU7YoKBiKw8CtOFSb2yZl1vNHtLbdm-_rpEQGLlAoOweCqHGKac5ibO3W1WvWXXM8H41GAR0N04sr31nPvWA6/s1600/logic+restructuring+-+5.png)
The bubbles at the input of NAND gate can be moved to the outputs of respective drivers. Or, saying, more sophistically, there are two NAND gates between **B** and **O**.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEic3dM6uen2KJtFB7zlym1wHevx7kMQPxEcWPZb6MF7MY4X51NDjN01jgHg-WRl5FFpQLc4IHnOyB_bHIAiRZBR8UNM3RnaBtZGVo-HQAo-nWZBx78A4YHPMrfRSTgjAnqYZjCDO2W8fx2a/s640/logic+restructuring+-+6.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEic3dM6uen2KJtFB7zlym1wHevx7kMQPxEcWPZb6MF7MY4X51NDjN01jgHg-WRl5FFpQLc4IHnOyB_bHIAiRZBR8UNM3RnaBtZGVo-HQAo-nWZBx78A4YHPMrfRSTgjAnqYZjCDO2W8fx2a/s1600/logic+restructuring+-+6.png)
Thus, we have achieved our purpose of
- Minimizing the logic
- Assuring that there is minimum logic between **B** and **O**, since **B** is the most timing critical input.
We need to keep in mind that there may be more than one solutions to each logic minimization problems. Can you think of a better realization of the circuit in question? What could have been the realization of the circuit in case C was the most timing critical input?

this is same as releasing a 8X1 Mux simply. How does B being critical input affect the realization?

This is same as realizing an 8X1 mux, and then restructuring such that we can give B input the highest priority. If you look at the last figure, there are lesser number of logic gates between B input and output.

### 22. How many 2-input muxes are needed to create an N-input mux

**Date:** 2019-02
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/02/how-many-2-input-muxes-are-needed-to.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2019/02/how-many-2-input-muxes-are-needed-to.html)

### How many 2-input muxes are needed to create an N-input mux
We all know that a 2-input multiplexer selects one out of the available two inputs. Similarly, an N-input multiplexer selects one out of the available N inputs. Now, coming to the answer of the question,
**The number of 2-input multiplexers needed to implement an N-input multiplexer is (N-1)**.
We will arrive at this conclusion by giving an example of an 8-input multiplexer implemented with the help of 2-input multiplexers. Each of the 2-input muxes reduces the number of signals by 1, thereby requiring total of "7" 2-input muxes to implement an 8-input mux.
Let us consider a circuit with 8 inputs and variable outputs. Firstly, if it has 8 outputs, there is no mux in-between.

| Figure 1: Circuit with 8 output lines to represent 8 input lines |
Now, if we add a 2-input mux between any of the 2 lines, then, we are reducing the number of output lines by 1 as shown in figure 2.
|     |

| Figure 2: Circuit with 7 output lines and 8 input lines |
Simlarly, adding another 2-input mux will leave the number of output lines to be 6. Figure 3 shows two of the all possible configurations of such circuits.
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBdD7K0SS28J3me7CzEU9lGHrFpH9DfRpz8JIeiyEi_w92iToNBBNCTVma922v6enG2rYxoaKnbhf0HGippZwpAogiEa5JupdAlWR6v1xBi_FwPgOBnnJRVJjGRJUj5Ai0g1_GlDcHPzeD/s640/8-6+mux.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBdD7K0SS28J3me7CzEU9lGHrFpH9DfRpz8JIeiyEi_w92iToNBBNCTVma922v6enG2rYxoaKnbhf0HGippZwpAogiEa5JupdAlWR6v1xBi_FwPgOBnnJRVJjGRJUj5Ai0g1_GlDcHPzeD/s1600/8-6+mux.png) |
| Figure 3: Circuits with 6 output lines and 8 input lines |
Similarly, continuing on similar lines, we will need "7" 2-input muxes to converge to a single output. Thus, we can say that "7" 2-input muxes make an 8-input mux.
Similarly, going by this, we will need 13 2-input muxes for a 14:1 mux, 31 for a 32:1 mux, and so on. In other words, (N-1) 2:1 muxes will make up an N-input mux.

### 1. 4x1 mux using NAND gates

**Date:** 2018-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/12/4x1-mux-using-nand-gates.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/12/4x1-mux-using-nand-gates.html)

### 4x1 mux using NAND gates
In the post [2x1 mux using NAND gates](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/2x1-mux-using-nand-gates.html), we discussed how we can use NAND gates to build a 2x1 multilexer. In this post, we will discuss how we can use NAND gates to build a 4x1 mux:
1\. **Using structural approach**: As we know that a 4x1 mux can be structurally built from 2x1 muxes as shown in figure 1 below. Thus, in the same way, we can arrange the 2-input NAND gates to build 4x1 muxes as shown in figure 1.
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggzg3cqv8FDO-6Q6_pQ2j5Q8MPmARGeI5r77k0swwAjy5QB8CmIAydUf4iVV06vbUYZVgNr4yCbNdbsxCjF7ylrYYXp9srfopyOxLpX8tfM-EZDcXHXXgiknswTdwogKPP53XV54X1xSN8/s640/4x1+mux+with+nand.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggzg3cqv8FDO-6Q6_pQ2j5Q8MPmARGeI5r77k0swwAjy5QB8CmIAydUf4iVV06vbUYZVgNr4yCbNdbsxCjF7ylrYYXp9srfopyOxLpX8tfM-EZDcXHXXgiknswTdwogKPP53XV54X1xSN8/s1600/4x1+mux+with+nand.png) |
| **Figure 1: 4x1 mux using NAND gates with structural approach** |
2\. **Building 4x1 mux directly from NAND gates**: The logical equation of a 4x1 multiplexer is given as:
> **Y = (S1' S0' A + S1' S0 B + S1 S0' C + S1 S0 D)**
where S1 and S0 are the selects of the multiplexer and A, B, C and D are the multiplexer inputs.
Now,  using De-morgan's law ( **m + n = (m'n')'**)
The above equation turns into,
> **Y = ((S1' S0' A)'  (S1' S0 B)' (S1 S0' C)' (S1 S0 D)')'**
In other words,
> **Y = NAND (NAND(S1',S0',A),NAND(S1',S0,B),NAND(S1,S0',C),NAND(S1,S0,D))**
Thus, we require four 3-input NAND gates and a 4-input NAND gate to implement a 4x1 mux. The implementation is shown in figure 2 below.

### 2. DESIGN PROBLEM : 4-bit increment by 2 circuit

**Date:** 2018-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/09/4-bit-increment-by-2-circuit.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/09/4-bit-increment-by-2-circuit.html)

### DESIGN PROBLEM : 4-bit increment by 2 circuit
Problem: Derive the logical expression for a 4-bit increment by 2 circuit and draw the architecture of it.
Solution: The task here is to design a circuit that increments its count by two. Since, it is a 4-bit circuit, the total number of possible states is 16. Each state transitions to the state which has a binary value two greater than it. Now, there are two possible scenarios based upon the initial state that the counter gets into:
1\. It can count 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 14 -> 0 (their binary equivalents)
2\. It can count 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9 -> 11 -> 13 -> 15 -> 1 (their binary equivalents)
The state transition table can be represented as shown below:

We can find the expression for outputs using K-maps as below.
**Expression for D3(next)**: Let us first derive the expression for D3(next). The K-map can be represented as below:
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJKIohGLN5ztDIc7F2m48XgKRxby8qoGisjS87dvQwrKZ-v6EP4XMt_dKITLHNvVqOusC_2dmALDj-m9HIySUNpcfHk80QNtgkDZ-O01uqA3SfIf2sqIHzvPbNTT78AH55xWZr8GgXUYi8/s320/K-map_1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJKIohGLN5ztDIc7F2m48XgKRxby8qoGisjS87dvQwrKZ-v6EP4XMt_dKITLHNvVqOusC_2dmALDj-m9HIySUNpcfHk80QNtgkDZ-O01uqA3SfIf2sqIHzvPbNTT78AH55xWZr8GgXUYi8/s1600/K-map_1.png)
The expression for D3(next) as derived from K-map is:
> D3(next) = D3.D2' + D3.D1' + D3'.D2.D1
> D3(next) = D3.(D2'+D1') + D3'.D2.D1.
> D3(next) = D3.(D2.D1)'+D3'.(D2.D1)
> D3(next) = D3 (exor) (D2.D1)
**Expression for D2(next)**: Given below is the K-map derived from state transition table for D2(next).

The expression for D2(next) as derived from K-map is:

**Expression for D1(next)**:  Given below is the K-map derived from state transition table for D1(next).

### 3. Clock gating checks in case of mux select transition when both clocks are running

**Date:** 2018-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/08/clock-gating-checks-in-case-of-mux.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/08/clock-gating-checks-in-case-of-mux.html)

### Clock gating checks in case of mux select transition when both clocks are running
**PROBLEM: In the following figure, it is desired to toggle the select of the mux from CLOCK\_DIV to CLOCK and both the clocks are running. What are the architectural and STA considerations for the same?**
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuOwU28YNf8krwMAklhpND7ZxcuZrhesepR1RrBCcFqHDJVTp4vV2O-0knnINj3x2eTx_T1x18onxFjCOitv_A-L1BxtMkwrQGi9RSs-_G-kuGmUgD5gC7IOqqfsm-h390w6ShtmubxdOR/s640/clock_gating_1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuOwU28YNf8krwMAklhpND7ZxcuZrhesepR1RrBCcFqHDJVTp4vV2O-0knnINj3x2eTx_T1x18onxFjCOitv_A-L1BxtMkwrQGi9RSs-_G-kuGmUgD5gC7IOqqfsm-h390w6ShtmubxdOR/s1600/clock_gating_1.png)
**SOLUTION**:
This is a very good example to understand how clock gating checks work, although you may/may not find any practical application for the same. We have to toggle the select of the multiplexer such that there is no glitch at the output. Let us consider architectural considerations first:
**Architectural considerations**:
> **Launching flip-flop of 'select' signal**: In the post [clock gating checks at a multiplexer](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/05/clock-gating-checks-at-multiplexer-mux.html), we discussed that if there is a mux getting clock at its inputs and select as data, then, there are two possible scenarios:
> - If the other clock is at state "0", then AND type check is formed and select has to launch from negative edge-triggered flip-flop
> - If the other clock is at state "1", then OR type check is formed and select has to launch from positive edge-triggered flip-flop
> Now, since both the clocks are running simultaneously, both with act as "other clock" for each other. Let us choose to keep both the clocks at state "0" when select toggles. The same discussion holds true for the other scenario as well, just that appropriate values will hold. Thus,
> **(i) Both clocks required to be at state '0' when clock toggles**
> **(ii) There is AND-type clock gating check formed between 'select' and both clocks**
> **(iii) 'select' launches from negative edge-triggered flip-flop**.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyylxZ-c8sMlW35wU8j4VqBzrxMKi6YxWlnmM9QM3WQR6xx3yK9J_c8zlS9FRaTzBAp8XOM8rhX5_Ns7yHjgPt3t6Xdi6TkxLS2vgP5EELPTJI7_ab7WVAvQcEEJ9WRQHDJCaUhmmKcgRX/s640/clock_gating_2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyylxZ-c8sMlW35wU8j4VqBzrxMKi6YxWlnmM9QM3WQR6xx3yK9J_c8zlS9FRaTzBAp8XOM8rhX5_Ns7yHjgPt3t6Xdi6TkxLS2vgP5EELPTJI7_ab7WVAvQcEEJ9WRQHDJCaUhmmKcgRX/s1600/clock_gating_2.png)
> **Valid negative edges when 'select' can toggle**: Now, as mentioned above both the clocks should be zero when select toggles. Figure below shows the valid and invalid edges where 'select' can toggle. As it turns out, select can toggle only on edges labelled "VALID" as both "CLOCK" and "DIV\_CLOCK" will be zero then.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip0j5e2OklE1Cb6pYM56IS9aqy9DA22oAkWRiDM7bkjrFdgH8ObsHR57-FLflWZxqjKD6IETglXJu_Gn_v5hUzqiQHi52RAu-a63bFbyj0ACk4TEEznUBRi1RefD3tdoBEpi1O_5wwPn3v/s640/clock_gating_3.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip0j5e2OklE1Cb6pYM56IS9aqy9DA22oAkWRiDM7bkjrFdgH8ObsHR57-FLflWZxqjKD6IETglXJu_Gn_v5hUzqiQHi52RAu-a63bFbyj0ACk4TEEznUBRi1RefD3tdoBEpi1O_5wwPn3v/s1600/clock_gating_3.png)
> So, to ensure that "SEL" toggles only when DIV\_CLOCK is "0", we can add logic to the input of the flip-flop launching "SEL" such that it allows to propagate "SEL" only when DIV\_CLOCK is "0".
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_HuPjsG8LsHomxzbFDE35SMO5M_sQSl_k2QhRwfSmwCEnk81Z5NqkFRbccbDVk4dFIP6b6xiTgSWBviJVY7j4e8eRJz9ezQ5e7cjSXdNwgqBkvw4X9BYhqFU2U444vS8yn7vFI5Rcoyev/s640/clock_gating_4.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_HuPjsG8LsHomxzbFDE35SMO5M_sQSl_k2QhRwfSmwCEnk81Z5NqkFRbccbDVk4dFIP6b6xiTgSWBviJVY7j4e8eRJz9ezQ5e7cjSXdNwgqBkvw4X9BYhqFU2U444vS8yn7vFI5Rcoyev/s1600/clock_gating_4.png)
> In the above diagram, flip-flop launching "SEL" will hold its value when DIV\_CLOCK = 0. We have to keep in mind that this implementation is just a representation of what needs to be done. the actual implementation may be more complex than this depending upon the requirements.
**Timing considerations**: Now coming to the timing considerations, we need to ensure that the setup and hold conditions are met, which are as shown in the figure below:

Hi sir
What will be the other input of mux i.e at 1 ?
I think it is also a select.
Does it correct or wrong

Hi Kalyan
Yes, the other input will act as "enable" for the clock coming at one input.

Hi sir,
In the above figure we need to give enable at zero input of mux and select at one input of mux right?

Hi Kalyan
No, that is not a compulsion. Theoretically, all the three inputs may get clock as well as data. But while calculating glitch probability at the output for one input as a clock, we will consider others as "enable" only. And vice-versa.

Hi
The basic fundamental is that we cant allow a glitch in clock path. This will happen only when select toggles either when both inputs are zero or when both inputs are one. While doing clock gating check analysis for one of the clocks, we need assume all the other inputs as data only. For example, for "CLOCK", to arrive at the type of clock gating check, we need to know the state of "DIV\_CLOCK" when the select toggles. If it is 0, then clock gating check will be AND-type and vice-versa. Similar is the case for "DIV\_CLOCK".
Now, there are for possible cases for both the clocks, "00", "01", "10" and "11". Out of these, "00" and "11" satisfy our criteria. So, we can design accordingly.
Let us say we design architecture such that select toggles only when the state is "00". This has been shown in this post too. So, we have to launch select from "negative edge of CLOCK", since we have to meet AND-type clock gating check with respect to both the clocks.
I hope I was able to answer your query. We can discuss more in case any clarity needed.

To make select to toggle only when both clocks are zero we need to give enable at zero input of mux so that negative flop also launch data at neg edge..so that it satisfy and gating check...

The basic idea is that there should not be any glitch at the output, which is taken care of in this example by toggling the select of mux when both clocks are zero, which forms AND check with both clocks. Another case could be toggling select when both clocks are 1, forming OR check. This would also make sense to prevent glitch at the output of the mux. It all depends upon what is the logic behind your RTL design implementation.

Hello,
you are saying:
\> In the above diagram, flip-flop launching "SEL" will hold its value when DIV\_CLOCK = 0.
But we want to CHANGE the value when DIV\_CLOCK=0
You need to connect the bottom flop output to the "1" input of the mux and not to "0"!
Am I missing something?
Best Regards,
David

simple solution would be "and clk and divclk" and use as clock to a neg edge trigged flop which outputs select

### 4. Intricacies in handling of half cycle timing paths

**Date:** 2018-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/08/intricacies-in-handling-of-half-cycle.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/08/intricacies-in-handling-of-half-cycle.html)

### Intricacies in handling of half cycle timing paths
**What is a half cycle path?** A half cycle timing path is one in which launch and capture happen on different clock edges. A half cycle path can be in terms of both setup and hold. However, normally, in technical terms half cycle path is the one which has setup check getting formed as half cycle. For instance, following are some of the examples of half cycle timing paths:
1. A timing path from positive edge-triggered flip-flop to a negative edge-triggered flip-flop and vice-verse. Here, hold check is also half cycle on the previous edge
2. A timing path from a positive level-sensitive latch to a negative level-sensitive latch and vice-verse. Here, hold check is zero cycle
3. A timing path from a negative edge-triggered flip-flop forming a clock gating check on AND gate (Here, hold check is zero cycle)
4. A timing path from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop forming a clock gating check on OR gate (here, hold check is zero cycle)
There are also, some cases where hold check is half cycle and setup check is single/zero cycle. These are:
1. A timing path from a negative edge-triggered flip-flop forming a clock gating check on OR gate (Here, setup check is single cycle check)
2. A timing path from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop forming a clock gating check on AND gate (Here, setup check is single cycle check)
In addition, minimu pulse width checks should also be considered same as half cycle timing paths. But, in this case, start-point and end-point are the same register.
In this post, we will be considering only setup timings paths as example, although the complete discussion applies on all kinds of half cycle setup paths/checks. To start with, let us note down the most simple setup check equation for half cycle timing paths.
> **Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup  < (Tperiod/2)** **\+ Tskew**
Let us now discuss some of the intricacies that we should be aware of while dealing with half cycle timing paths:
**Clock source duty cycle variation:** There is always a variation in duty cycle of the clock source due to uncertainty in the relative timings of positive and negative edges. Duty cycle variation is always measured with respect to corresponding positive and negative edges. In other words, we can also say that duty cycle variation is the uncertainty in arrival of negative edge, given that positive edge has arrived at certain fixed point of time. Let us take an example. If we are given a clock with a period of 10 ns with ideal 50% duty cycle. Also, we are given that it has the clock has a duty cycle variation of +-5%. So, if we say that we saw positive edge of clock at 100 ns, we can expect to see negative edge of clock at any time between 14.5 ns and 15.5 ns. Following waveform illustrates this. You can read my earlier post [duty cycle variation](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/10/duty-cycle-variation.html) to have a more detailed elaboration.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDv2N2gp5Vve3RRsBQhhFySZd6NjFRxxN4Q0o1wF_AJOiGG54oBY3ZbWYD_YeuZXANYIx9dmKKceJ_VxaG53oe1cqrsoDVmjU3WEHXIIb0UB8QvIyGhFqhWrPBkHelTBax4k0nliNtVDMR/s640/duty+cycle.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDv2N2gp5Vve3RRsBQhhFySZd6NjFRxxN4Q0o1wF_AJOiGG54oBY3ZbWYD_YeuZXANYIx9dmKKceJ_VxaG53oe1cqrsoDVmjU3WEHXIIb0UB8QvIyGhFqhWrPBkHelTBax4k0nliNtVDMR/s640/duty+cycle.png)
So, the setup check equation modifies as:
> **Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup  < (Tperiod/ 2-** **Tsdc** **)** **\+ Tskew**
where **Tsdc** is the clock source duty cycle variation. Thus, the effective half clock period reduces by an amount equal to duty cycle variation.
**Duty cycle degradation**: In addition to source duty cycle variation, there can be assymmetry in rise delay vs fall delay of clock elements. For instance, a buffer may have nominal rise (0 -> 1) delay of 50 ns whereas 48 ns for fall delay (1 -> 0). So, if a clock pulse passes through it, it will eat a portion of this clock pulse as shown in figure 1 below. For more clarity, we have exaggerated the scenario with a fall delay of 30 ns.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHNIqHMRIJvjiFp_ITQPEkiFjznonxSFnbrztDjIJEGL5Sbd0iK_gUY5uw_-ck2U5g27oIs0cyPMMdVOQY7ckaYff8u5_jnz5WvOl8AKdHEsWJ5Yjp0SZNTMfb2lmral1nPZ5lMiarAN7r/s640/duty_cycle_degradation.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHNIqHMRIJvjiFp_ITQPEkiFjznonxSFnbrztDjIJEGL5Sbd0iK_gUY5uw_-ck2U5g27oIs0cyPMMdVOQY7ckaYff8u5_jnz5WvOl8AKdHEsWJ5Yjp0SZNTMfb2lmral1nPZ5lMiarAN7r/s640/duty_cycle_degradation.png)
So, a half cycle may be larger of smaller than actual half cycle at the clock pin. In the above case, positive to negative edge setup check will be tighter by 20 ns and negative-> positive setup check will be relaxed by same amount (neglective OCVs as of now). So, the modified setup equation, now, becomes:
> **Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup  < (Tperiod/2 -** **Tsdc** **)** **\+ (Tskew** **-** **Tdcd** **)**
As discussed above also, **Tdcd** can be positive or negative depending upon if rise-fall variation of cells is helping or oppsing.
Can you think of some other scenario that is specific only to half cycle timing paths? Do share, if you do.

Hi
Duty cycle defradation will affect half cycle hold paths only, the same way it does affect half cycle setup paths. However, most of the paths are usually zero cycle hold paths, hence, not affected by duty cycle degradation.
This post mentions following scenarios as half cycle hold check as an example.
There are also, some cases where hold check is half cycle and setup check is single/zero cycle. These are:
A timing path from a negative edge-triggered flip-flop forming a clock gating check on OR gate (Here, setup check is single cycle check)
A timing path from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop forming a clock gating check on AND gate (Here, setup check is single cycle check)

### 5. Is hold always checked on the same edge?

**Date:** 2018-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/07/is-hold-always-checked-on-same-edge.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/07/is-hold-always-checked-on-same-edge.html)

### Is hold always checked on the same edge?
One of the guys asked me a question, "Why is hold always checked on the same edge?" Normally, it is taught in books/colleges that hold is frequency independent because it is checked on same edge. But, is it really true? It is true only for some of the many cases. Hold can be checked on the same edge, next edge or previous edge depending upon the scenario. In this post, we will discuss those cases one by one, and try to generalize if this statement holds true.
How to determine the edge on which hold check needs to be checked: For most of us, it seems quite confusing to arrive at the conclusion of how to determine the hold edge. Let us try to use a state machine perspective here. In state machine theory, we study that synchronous digital circuits can be considered as state machines moving from one state to another. This state transition happens on each clock edge as shown in figure 1 below.
|     |
| [![In digital circuits, we can say that each clock edge (either positive or negative) corresponds to an independent state.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRCAXxgNkKk7I5hVPyOeiaoA0lzXew9D56jsMcdYHE57-YzVlS_jv5516clsdXEqHi6-PXl_jGQ_GeL6lvECZL6oVpb2ph1R_GYDjqaszR2txVzr2XVCSJhBmeylEzIjNNeHvnZ8qwAMJM/s640/state_tran.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRCAXxgNkKk7I5hVPyOeiaoA0lzXew9D56jsMcdYHE57-YzVlS_jv5516clsdXEqHi6-PXl_jGQ_GeL6lvECZL6oVpb2ph1R_GYDjqaszR2txVzr2XVCSJhBmeylEzIjNNeHvnZ8qwAMJM/s1600/state_tran.png) |
| **Figure 1: Each clock edge corresponds to a design state** |
If we look at each flip-flop, every positive edge-triggered flip-flop changes its state at positive clock edge and all negative edge-triggered flip-flops transition state at negative clock edge. Similarly, all negative edge-triggered flip-flops transition state at negative clock edge as shown in figure 2 below.
|     |
| [![We can assume that all positive edge-triggered flip-flops transition their states at positive edges and all negative edge-triggered flip-flops transition their states at negative edges of clock](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLDyPGTk_ODc2wBrKDixU_QscfVKLObSleKAZkladPzGQquYM8mLIxGdM6XbHBZC2hyPIbduP8eOi6TT-xTOMZ4GuVVLX6vJ5Pob9TiKaTWh5IaQGhUPojtpcQksSx2ZaqvpZfNxMqhvdf/s640/flop+state+tran.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLDyPGTk_ODc2wBrKDixU_QscfVKLObSleKAZkladPzGQquYM8mLIxGdM6XbHBZC2hyPIbduP8eOi6TT-xTOMZ4GuVVLX6vJ5Pob9TiKaTWh5IaQGhUPojtpcQksSx2ZaqvpZfNxMqhvdf/s1600/flop+state+tran.png) |
| **Figure 2: State transition for positive edge-triggered and negative edge-triggered flip-flops** |
Or, we can represent the states of positive edge-triggered and negative edge-triggered flops as separate as shown in figure 3 below.

| **Figure 3: States of positive and negative edge-triggered flops represented symbolically** |
Let us have a scenario of a timing path from a positive edge-triggered flop to a positive edge-triggered flop. In the figure 4 below, flip-flop "2" transitions to state (K+1) depending upon the value of flip-flop "1" at state (K).

| **Figure 4: A sample timing path from positive edge-triggered flip-flop to positive edge-triggered flip-flop** |
Here, the data launched from ff1 should help ff2 transition to state "K+1", meaning, it should be captured at the corresponding clock edge. This represents setup check. Also, it should not disturb state "K" of ff2, meaning it should not get captured at this edge. This represents hold check. So, in this case hold check is on the same edge as the present state of start and end flops is the same edge.

| **Figure 5: Setup and hold checks for positive-to-positive edge-triggered timing paths** |
Now, let us take a look on the scenario where-in hold check is not on the same edge. Let us take a timing path launching data from negative edge and capturing at positive edge. This scenario is shown in figure 6 below.
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEijrxiaayxzu2xgkGlisefTacghtux0a5b2juPFvgdjzR1jKitEIYTEZh8TQYjp9BQAVychsAamIYwq7ic4TSVE-BamelxmFQxmj8sRj366m-kxJlGQJl1zYd6syGOoJh3vRTws-Y9ydeyZ/s320/setup+path+neg.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEijrxiaayxzu2xgkGlisefTacghtux0a5b2juPFvgdjzR1jKitEIYTEZh8TQYjp9BQAVychsAamIYwq7ic4TSVE-BamelxmFQxmj8sRj366m-kxJlGQJl1zYd6syGOoJh3vRTws-Y9ydeyZ/s1600/setup+path+neg.png) |
| **Figure 6: Timing path from negative-to-positive edge-triggered flop** |
Here, positive edge-triggered flip-flop transitions states on positive edge and negative edge-triggered flop transitions on negative edges. So, the data launched from negative edge-triggered flop corresponding to state "X" should get captured on positive edge-triggered flop on state "Y+1", which corresponds to setup check. And it should not get captured on state "Y", which corresponds to hold check.

### 6. Design puzzle : 2-input mux glitch issue

**Date:** 2018-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/05/design-puzzle-2-input-mux-glitch-issue.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/05/design-puzzle-2-input-mux-glitch-issue.html)

### Design puzzle : 2-input mux glitch issue
**Problem statement: A 2-input multiplexer has both of its inputs getting value of "1". Will there be any toggle (glitch) happening at the output of the multiplexer? If yes, is that expected? What if both the inputs are getting value of "0"?**
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjh04kEbLlZW0cQXV93rKmHeLxnUfupfXWCgCiFLwL9RTA4pn0074DqbWqK5PJ0-63Ig-TbW9SBe2YZlxHsVQWMcDpCCqj39_wsbYqeQjjzeJ_CLmgT3OkrHl0tcf1FhfxRkkgW4YaMzlX2/s640/mux_toggle.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjh04kEbLlZW0cQXV93rKmHeLxnUfupfXWCgCiFLwL9RTA4pn0074DqbWqK5PJ0-63Ig-TbW9SBe2YZlxHsVQWMcDpCCqj39_wsbYqeQjjzeJ_CLmgT3OkrHl0tcf1FhfxRkkgW4YaMzlX2/s1600/mux_toggle.png)
**Answer:**
We all know that a multiplexer's output is equal to
> IN0 if SEL = 0
> IN1 if SEL =1
So, if both IN0 and IN1 are getting same logic value, output must not toggle. However, if we observe carefully, there is a high chance of a momentary glitch at the output in case both inputs are at value "1" and select toggles from "1" to "0". To understand this, we need to look into the internal structure of the mux, which is as shown in figure 2 below.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhOCw4c_ezpfTxYGX-oBhGaxnxSrs9BRg0NwEOv4V5VRsEQ97felE4AEQq7sUh0B8Y6ul2SoF_cl3YIS6UmrO7wm3QIgJQwJkOF8wZR2uJ1b64MIkZhMW_vb5Z6GpwclyvGYL87Tz4mnMI3/s640/mux_internal.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhOCw4c_ezpfTxYGX-oBhGaxnxSrs9BRg0NwEOv4V5VRsEQ97felE4AEQq7sUh0B8Y6ul2SoF_cl3YIS6UmrO7wm3QIgJQwJkOF8wZR2uJ1b64MIkZhMW_vb5Z6GpwclyvGYL87Tz4mnMI3/s1600/mux_internal.png)
The figure says that output goes momentarily to "0" before finally settling down to "1". Why is this so? The reason behind this is the two paths going from SEL to OUT and toggling of both the inputs of final OR gate. And there is asymmetry of delays with one inverter being extra in one of the paths. This causes the output of the mux to go momentarily to zero.
Let us analyze this with the help of timing waveforms (assuming delay of each element to be 1 unit):
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOBFcwTwdztc1lNBUxVcXkraKusj5hkDRElv0TbHegLkT0hMpfp5kMy3fy0FvAFcTCAvnwbWhSsGxLtLoMtlGb8TUUhLINEc08LURNX2_zlNvMC2SdgAeG4QcHvo_czVClbxjeu9OYjAet/s320/mux_timing.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOBFcwTwdztc1lNBUxVcXkraKusj5hkDRElv0TbHegLkT0hMpfp5kMy3fy0FvAFcTCAvnwbWhSsGxLtLoMtlGb8TUUhLINEc08LURNX2_zlNvMC2SdgAeG4QcHvo_czVClbxjeu9OYjAet/s1600/mux_timing.png)
Thus, it is clear from the timing waveforms that there is a glitch in the output. It is possible to minimize the extent of this glitch by minimizing the difference of delays between the two paths getting formed between the SEL and OUT. However, it cannot be guaranteed even with greatest of precision during design as there are mismatches in fabrication of individual gates. So, even the best of multiplexers will have this limitation, however small it may be, unless designed specifically for this purpose. Can you suggest a design improvement that can help in this scenario?
One is forced to think here that what can be the consequences of such a glitch and what remedies can be there for this. I had written a post [Glitches in combinational circuits](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2017/10/glitches-in-combinational-circuits.html) that discussed what can be the consequences of glitches in combinational circuits. This scenario is a special case, but with some twist. Let us discuss all the cases one by one.
- If this case is in a data path for synchronous circuits, there is no issue as discussed in one of the points in our post [Glitches in combinational circuits](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2017/10/glitches-in-combinational-circuits.html).
- If this case happens for a data path in asynchronous circuits, this can be an issue. So, synchronization circuits have to be designed with utmost care and following the rules of data synchronization
- If this scenario occurs in either path of clock or reset, this is an issue as this glitch can alter the state of the design by either letting the flop capture data at "D" pin by acting as an extra clock pulse, or can reset the flop.

### 7. Setup time and hold time - origin

**Date:** 2018-01
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/01/setup-and-hold-device-perspective.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/01/setup-and-hold-device-perspective.html)

### Setup time and hold time - origin
In our previous post, **Setup and hold – the state machine perspective**, we discussed how setup and hold can be defined in respect of state machines. Interestingly, there is another perspective of setup and hold – that in repect to devices, known as setup and hold time requirements. For a device, (for example a flip-flop, a latch or an SoC), setup and hold times are defined as:
**Setup time**: Setup time of a device is defined as the minimum time before the clock edge the data should be kept stable so that it is reliably sampled by the clock.
**Hold time**: Hold time of a device is defined as the minimum time after the clock edge the data should be kept stable so that it is reliably sampled by the clock.
In other words, every device has a setup and hold window surrounding the active clock edge within which data should be kept stable. As is shown in figure 1, brown line represents the active clock edge, blue line represents setup window and red line represents hold window. As is shown, data can toggle at any time except between setup and hold windows. Toggling of data between setup-hold window means flip-flop might go into metastable state and the output of flip-flop does not remain predictable.

| **Figure 1: Setup and hold checks** |
**Origin of setup and hold timing requirements**: Let us consider a positive edge-triggered flip-flop. Figure 2 shows a most simplistic circuit for a practical flip-flop. Inverters I1, I2 and Transmission gates G1, G2 constitute master latch and I3, I4, G3, G4 constitute slave latch.
|     |
| [![A positive edge-triggered flip-flop consists of master and slave latches, each of which consists of two inverters connected in positive loop back mode and two transmission gates](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8CjjEeljfA9RiumkX2uZpgDDvsbfdTVzuk8DZgpTAejBf4H-nng5StFzY_uVki8_kI2gF6vgt3ywafSt4EZXQik3Rr9DaQ8tLtvQHM1czohKRCIb8j8lfL8Im6OklFLGGCsm_eLPoeRk/s1600/positive+edge+register.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8CjjEeljfA9RiumkX2uZpgDDvsbfdTVzuk8DZgpTAejBf4H-nng5StFzY_uVki8_kI2gF6vgt3ywafSt4EZXQik3Rr9DaQ8tLtvQHM1czohKRCIb8j8lfL8Im6OklFLGGCsm_eLPoeRk/s1600/positive+edge+register.png) |
| **Figure 2: A typical practical circuit for negative edge-triggered flip-flop** |
Figure 3 below shows the origin of setup time requirement. For data to get latched properly, it should complete the feedback loop of master latch before the closing edge of clock at transmission gate G4. So, setup time requirement of the flip-flop is:
**Tsetup = TG3 \+ TI1 \+ TI2 \+ TG4**
|     |
| [![The setup check of a flip-flop consists of delay of input transmission gate and feedback transmission gate and the two inverters of master latch](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgb0GVJPAvQQv6PC22UW6M-TjrPnWaJJKw4JrQX0XVvsEAlN2J_Fl7WtBVgYxqgVaUW95OnBGh7szU1Iffe5yCYh4wqbl3EO3nubnZrhbu0nZa_EnwPYiwkTiR15towgNve86y-U5MI3UA/s1600/setup+check+delay.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgb0GVJPAvQQv6PC22UW6M-TjrPnWaJJKw4JrQX0XVvsEAlN2J_Fl7WtBVgYxqgVaUW95OnBGh7szU1Iffe5yCYh4wqbl3EO3nubnZrhbu0nZa_EnwPYiwkTiR15towgNve86y-U5MI3UA/s1600/setup+check+delay.png) |
| **Figure 3: Figure demonstrating delays constituting setup check** |
Similarly, figure 4 below shows the origin of hold timing requirement. For data to get latched properly, the next data should not cross inverter I1. So, hold timing requirement of the flip-flop is:
**Thold = -(TG3 \+ T** **I1** **)**
In other words, hold time is the minimum time required for the data to change after the clock edge has passed so that new data does not get captured at the present clock edge.

I think thold=0 . For negative edge triggered flipflop thold is time after the negative edge for which the input should be held stable. As soon as the clock goes low G3 turns off and any change in input won't be reflected. So hold time should be 0.

In my opinion, even if data crosses the transmission gate; until it reaches the output of inverter, the inverter will again cause the transmission gate output to go to previous value after clock goes off.

### 1. Design problem: Clock gating for a shift register

**Date:** 2017-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/12/design-problem-clock-gating-for-shift.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/12/design-problem-clock-gating-for-shift.html)

### Design problem: Clock gating for a shift register
**Problem: There is an 4-bit shift register with parallel read and write capability as shown in the diagram. We need to find out an opportunity to clock gate the module.**
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCY7-N-raM1LNTKqEv4G2sQaaWxbOf97URKEW2CjHSwrbNdgsstCmLfJZn4VALuqVRX8VAhCBX6HY9thdrdBcYomZnP-TCKdBPJgUNk5eHkDJFtco53NMNeayLbgX71Y_eD_PB0_UxjR0Q/s640/shift+register+clock+gating.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCY7-N-raM1LNTKqEv4G2sQaaWxbOf97URKEW2CjHSwrbNdgsstCmLfJZn4VALuqVRX8VAhCBX6HY9thdrdBcYomZnP-TCKdBPJgUNk5eHkDJFtco53NMNeayLbgX71Y_eD_PB0_UxjR0Q/s1600/shift+register+clock+gating.png)
**Mode selection bits ("S1" and "S0") are controlling the operation of this shift register with following settings**:
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihWJE0IdfjbegvrC5b93-7NtwG7kki4osjzYkJbwWMbMTqTfOdwDrnU_1W0d-PVSl20FTtahFVzijMei6wwNBtStLA9isMfoXkWDb6Sf-WwAV8Cl4eh2PAiO5VCfLl9wrf45teMdx4mANr/s640/shift+register+clock+gating+settings.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihWJE0IdfjbegvrC5b93-7NtwG7kki4osjzYkJbwWMbMTqTfOdwDrnU_1W0d-PVSl20FTtahFVzijMei6wwNBtStLA9isMfoXkWDb6Sf-WwAV8Cl4eh2PAiO5VCfLl9wrf45teMdx4mANr/s1600/shift+register+clock+gating+settings.png)
**Solution**: From the basics of clock gating, we know that if the stae of a flip-flop is not chaging, there lies an opportunity to gate its clock. Observing the table, we see that state of all flip-flops does not change when "S1,S0" are either "00" or "11". So, when mode selection bits are corresponding to these values, we can gate the clock to this shift register. Or, we can say that clock to the module should reach only when (S1 xor S0) is equal to 1.

Can you relate the timing of S1 and S0? Should they be coming from positive edge-triggered flip-flop or negative edge-triggered flip-flop? [Clock gating checks](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2014/05/clock-switching-and-clock-gating-checks.html) explains the timing of clock gating signals with respect to clock.

### 2. MOS transistor structure

**Date:** 2017-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/12/mos-transistor-structure.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/12/mos-transistor-structure.html)

### MOS transistor structure
A MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor), or MOS, as is commonly called, is an electronic device which converts change in input voltage into a change in output current. The basic structure of a MOS transistor (as seen sideways) is as shown in figure 1. The substrate is a lightly doped semiconductor. Source and Drain regions are heavily doped regions of type opposite to substrate. In-between source and drain is a region called channel. Above the channel is a very thin layer of oxide.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9Pwqixo12qZ6XkgRh5jJLCFbO9G-DZMMr8EQy1zEEHwA4GD1bOjyITX6Q3fX5HbMlyEU2gn2lcCfjy0-DKGKMcSdb6XOUR9tuGg7B9nYw2g-kf40sckuhDKfCagWE0Cremby4bNOHLX8x/s320/mos.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9Pwqixo12qZ6XkgRh5jJLCFbO9G-DZMMr8EQy1zEEHwA4GD1bOjyITX6Q3fX5HbMlyEU2gn2lcCfjy0-DKGKMcSdb6XOUR9tuGg7B9nYw2g-kf40sckuhDKfCagWE0Cremby4bNOHLX8x/s1600/mos.png)
The voltage is applied to input terminal, which is called "Gate" terminal. If sufficient voltage is applied at the gate terminal, a channel gets formed between source and drain terminals. Depending upon the nature of channel formed, MOS is termed as N-MOS or P-MOS.
**N-MOS**: For an N-MOS, substrate is P-type, source and drain regions are N-type. Application of a positive voltage at Gate terminal with respect to substrate will result in formation of channel of electrons.
**P-MOS**: For a P-MOS, substrate is N-type, source and drain regions are P-type. Application of a negative voltage at Gate terminal with respect to substrate will result in formation of channel of holes.

### 3. What is the difference between a normal buffer and clock buffer?

**Date:** 2017-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/12/what-is-difference-between-normal.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/12/what-is-difference-between-normal.html)

### What is the difference between a normal buffer and clock buffer?
A buffer is an element which produces an output signal, which is of the same value as the input signal. We can also refer a buffer as a repeater which repeats the signal it is receiving, just as there are repeaters in telephone signal transmission lines. You must have noticed that we have two kinds of buffers (or any logic gate) available in standard cell libraries as:
- Clock buffer: The clock buffers are designed specifically to have specific properties that are supposed to be good for clock distribution networks (clock trees). The specific properties that are required in an ideal clock tree buffer are given as below. However, it is not possible to attain these ideal properties for every buffer at every technology node. It may be only possible to get close to these properties.
  - Equal rise and fall times
  - Less delays
  - Less delay variations with PVT and OCV
- Normal buffer/data buffer: For a data buffer, the above properties are usually less desired
Usually, we can say that following differences may exist between a clock buffer and a normal buffer:
- In SoCs, clock routing is done in higher metal layers as compared to signal routing. So, to provide easier access to clock pins from these layers, clock buffers may have pins in higher metal layers. That is, vias are provided in standard cell itself instead of necessitating on having in clock distribution network. For a data buffer, the pins are expected to be in lower layers only.
- Clock buffers are balanced. In other words, rise and fall times of clock buffers are nearly equal. The reason behind this is that if the clock buffers are not balanced, there will be duty cycle distortion in the clock tree, which can lead to pulse width violations as discussed in [minimum pulse width violation example](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2017/11/minimum-pulse-width-violation-example.html). On the other hand, data buffers can compromise with either of rise/fall times. In other words, they dont need to have PMOS/NMOS size to be 2:1; and hence, can be of smaller size as compared to clock buffers.
- Due to above reason, clock buffers consume more power as compared to normal buffers.
- Generally, you will find clock buffers with higher drive strength as compared to normal buffers. So that a clock buffer can drive long nets and can have higher fanouts. This helps clock buffers, and hence, clock trees to have less overall delays.

Hi
1\. As discussed, clock buffers have symmetrical rise and fall delays, which causes PMOS to have higher size than normal buffer. Thus, the power is more because of bigger device size.
2\. Clock buffers receive more toggling activity than normal buffers, thereby consuming more power.

Could you share some more detail with feature" Less delay variations with PVT and OCV", benefit for example?

Hi
One of the examples may be that a clock buffer may have wires of greater width than a normal buffer so that the width variations are not that prominent.

Hi,
How doubling the width of pmos to nMOS ratio.helps in making equal rise and fall times of clock buffers

Hi Smita
PMOS usually have higher resistance than NMOS due to lesser mobility of holes. And we know that rise and fall times is essentially time taken to charge the capacitor at the output, given by Q = I \* t. Now, I depends upon R, the value of resistance. In simplistic terms, to make rise and fall times of the gate equal, we will need to have PMOS of higher width so that resistance of PMOS is comparable to that of NMOS. In some technology, this factor may be two. This is where doubling number comes from.

hat basis you tell pmos and nmos size is 2:1 ratio in clock buffer and why clock has equal rise and equal fall

Hi
When I said that pmos & nmos size should be 2:1, there I assumed that PMOS to NMOS substrate resistivity is in the same ratio. So, in order to pass same current, the size of PMOS required is twice (this is a very simple approximation taken in most of the texts).
Now, under most scenarios, a clock buffer is expected to not distort clock pulse. This is possible only if it has equal rise and fall delays. So, a clock buffer design should be done taking this into consideration.
I would recommend you to go through this post to help you understand better.

Hi
Any buffer in CMOS is a pair of inverters connected back to back, since you cannot create non-inverting logic with enhancement type of MOSFETs.
The special thing in clock buffers is mentioned in the post that differentiate it from normal buffers.

Hi, If the clock buffer has so many strengths, why in the design do we not use the entire clock buffer, but have to use the data buffer?

Hi, there is a very simple reason behind this. To make clock buffers symmetrical, you have to sacrifice area and power. So, in order to save area, every buffer in the design cannot be a clock buffer. :-) It is like saying, you dont use granite in every construction even though it is very strong and durable.

Hello,
say we are comparing a data and clock buffer of same drive strength, is the clock buffer larger than the data buffer ? (This would explain the area impact for the above question)

Hi, very interesting article. I wanted to know more about this clock buffer because, wandering around the internet, I can't find anything of what it's like inside. Some say it is made up of two inverters in series and some say it is a non-inverting amplifier. Could you tell me something about it or direct me to a resource that explains the clock buffer very well and can clarify my doubts? Thank you

In my opinion, you should be able to get the information from datasheet of the FPGA. However, there is a 99% chance that the clock buffer will be 2 inverters connected back-to-back even in FPGA, since CMOS technology doesnt allow a non-inverting amplifier. Its just that the transistor sizes will be huge to allow 1. long nets to be driver 2. less variation

### 4. Performance gain with latches

**Date:** 2017-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/12/latch-performance-gain.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/12/latch-performance-gain.html)

### Performance gain with latches
The property of latches being transparent gives them a basic characteristic, known as time borrowing, owing to which they can capture data over a period of time rather than an instant. Using this property of latches intelligently can result in performance advantage for specific design scenarios, especially for designs having asymmetric data paths in subsequent stages. Let us elaborate with the help of an example.
Let us suppose a design having two stages of pipeline with combinational logic in each stage as 12 ns and 5 ns respectively as shown in figure 1 below:
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEyjSDZTeud_iaVNLOPbXsTwPmUkRUw3zlz-0kKX-w3rF0Dq6gXTKs4_x7s2nOcwUHEiXFXrwPj9q7Dx4VQ071Xg9E1l7gKXJtKJWixOaNfiKVH3YV4kQR0lbpnbnJhMIu3DUfE0JoLb6F/s640/2-stage+pipeline.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEyjSDZTeud_iaVNLOPbXsTwPmUkRUw3zlz-0kKX-w3rF0Dq6gXTKs4_x7s2nOcwUHEiXFXrwPj9q7Dx4VQ071Xg9E1l7gKXJtKJWixOaNfiKVH3YV4kQR0lbpnbnJhMIu3DUfE0JoLb6F/s1600/2-stage+pipeline.png) |
| **Figure 1: 2-stage pipelining** |
If we assume clock period to be 16 ns (half cycle being 8 ns), then each latch stage will borrow time from the subsequent stage as shown in figure below:
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgjzhH6e4-y_Kurpb2C2ic4UhNJA7e_4KeSNy_m4qE7axdhDDgeN5GMhHSvGqhwOsm13PMBWU0fQ3-X7Oug15J2OWfDpkL4XNMeySQA4ZuspKVQ_eVSDCpAM-A9h43v1yzoAAPB9SZTgHYC/s640/time+borrowing+for+multi-stage+latch+pipeline.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgjzhH6e4-y_Kurpb2C2ic4UhNJA7e_4KeSNy_m4qE7axdhDDgeN5GMhHSvGqhwOsm13PMBWU0fQ3-X7Oug15J2OWfDpkL4XNMeySQA4ZuspKVQ_eVSDCpAM-A9h43v1yzoAAPB9SZTgHYC/s1600/time+borrowing+for+multi-stage+latch+pipeline.png)
.
Now, since all the registers get the same clock signal, the minimu clock period is the maximum of combinational delays from REGA to REGB and REGB to REGC.
Tclk \> MAX (TcombregA->regB, Tcombr(regB->regC))
Thus, this circuit cannot run with half clock period less than 12 ns, or clock period less than 24 ns.
This situation can be easened up if we replace REGB with a negative level-sensitive latch. Let us have a look at figure 2 below. Although the number of stages still remains the same, LATB can borrow time from next stage without impacting any logic.
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSW3siaQNcykB9B4zdzli6hvESX9B39Qn4YT3udiKhilM6Oyu7zejkJmvjwjsOeg2y3rsYoxy2UZDjDprg5Nu1jKsBa-9a5RaXhqYf0Xmb3Pw0MVqlrtJIv1z66_AFD6aBMYTD4RhwBrjF/s640/2-stage+pipeline+with+latch.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSW3siaQNcykB9B4zdzli6hvESX9B39Qn4YT3udiKhilM6Oyu7zejkJmvjwjsOeg2y3rsYoxy2UZDjDprg5Nu1jKsBa-9a5RaXhqYf0Xmb3Pw0MVqlrtJIv1z66_AFD6aBMYTD4RhwBrjF/s1600/2-stage+pipeline+with+latch.png) |
| **Figure 2: Latch replacing register in the 2-stage pipelining** |
The same is shown in figure 3 below with the help of waveform. The clock is having a period of 9 ns. The latch can borrow time of 3 ns from next stage, still meeting the setup time by 1 ns. Thus, we have succeeded in reducing the half time period from 12 ns to 9 ns (time period from 24 ns to 18 ns), just by changing the register to a latch. This is how a latch can help gain in performance.
If there are multiple latch stages in series, each can borrow from the subsequent stage such that overall timing is met. For example, figure 3 shows 6 latches in series.

In the case described above of RegA -> LatB -> RegC, how will the setup and hold of LatB will be fullfilled as the combi delay from RegA -> LatB is 12ns which is more than clock period which is assumed to be 9ns.

Hi
Yes, the time period should have been 24 ns here. I have corrected the text. Thanks for your valuable feedback.

### 5. How delay of a standard cell changes with drive strength

**Date:** 2017-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/12/how-delay-of-standard-cell-changes-with.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/12/how-delay-of-standard-cell-changes-with.html)

### How delay of a standard cell changes with drive strength
A standard cell (let us say a buffer) can be represented as shown in figure 1 below, where
> R = Channel resistance
> Cds = Drain-to-source capacitance (internal capacitance of cell)
> Cload = Load capacitance
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQ0-OSkvQJJCCQqSI1x5rbmq3WBvZvVlHfuufZf_v759KRb3WVjkuE1Lse48yvAr-MsVtfYkTvaiT4kPUFb2FVgUcvjcjRLV2FHknRG0jhYBl1Dp6NNy1s8Ca8mIHaWZbJOFHBewK4tQc1/s320/delay+model+of+gate.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQ0-OSkvQJJCCQqSI1x5rbmq3WBvZvVlHfuufZf_v759KRb3WVjkuE1Lse48yvAr-MsVtfYkTvaiT4kPUFb2FVgUcvjcjRLV2FHknRG0jhYBl1Dp6NNy1s8Ca8mIHaWZbJOFHBewK4tQc1/s1600/delay+model+of+gate.png)
So, RC time constant can be represented as "R \* (Cds + Cload)".
**What happens on increasing the drive strength**? In our post " [what is meant by drive strength](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2017/11/what-is-meant-by-drive-strength-of.html)", we discussed that the drive strength of a standard cell increases when we increase the size of its transistors. So, basically, a cell with drive strength 2X will have twice of width as compared to the one with 1X drive strength.
And we know that
> Channel resistance decreases with "W".
> Drain-to-source capacitance increases with "W".
So,  upon increasing the drive strength, its internal capacitance will increase and channel resistance will reduce by same amount. The same is depicted in figure 2 below.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjtnByvK6w9JpXNCTUIXr32aQO3BYTmA8QPzT87nkXXYHdCq-G-KX4H7pijJES8twNRGhkPMNCJ-IG9fuMhXhPC3lWZ9SviN69Cd0G-oTe-AeH8XtPNW5D0WWn_gGLDuihyfhRISe5T2-xf/s640/Picture6.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjtnByvK6w9JpXNCTUIXr32aQO3BYTmA8QPzT87nkXXYHdCq-G-KX4H7pijJES8twNRGhkPMNCJ-IG9fuMhXhPC3lWZ9SviN69Cd0G-oTe-AeH8XtPNW5D0WWn_gGLDuihyfhRISe5T2-xf/s1600/Picture6.png)
> Time constant of "1X" buffer = R \* (Cds + Cload)
> Time constant of "2X" buffer = R/2 \* (2Cds + Cload)
Now, let us talk of following scenarios:
**Special case 1**: Load capacitance is negligible.
In this scenario, we are left with only internal resistance and capacitance of the cell.
> Time constant of "1X" buffer = R \* Cds
> Time constant of "2X" buffer = R \* Cds
So, in this case, there should not be any impact of increasing the drive strength of standard cell on delay. So, in case there is negligible load, we should not upsize the standard cell. Doing so may instead increase the overall path delay as increased drive strength cell will present increased load to the previous stage cell, thereby increasing the delay of previous stage.
**Special case 2**: Load capacitance is very large as compared to internal capacitance.
In this scenario,
> Time constant of "1X" buffer = R \* Cload
> Time constant of "2X" buffer = (R \* Cload ) / 2
So, second buffer will take approximately half the time to charge the load capacitance as compared to "1X" buffer.
So, we see that the the maximum possible benefit in delay by increasing the drive strength of standard cell is a reduction by a factor of two. In the worst case, we may not see any benefit at all.
We can also look at above equation by splitting cell delay into two components:
1. Cell delay due to its own intrinsic capacitance: It does not scale by drive strength and is a constant value for one kind of standard cells.
2. Cell delay due to external load capacitance: It is variable and decreases as we increase the drive strength of standard cell.

thanks. i have one question..
if i use the up size drive strength cell, i have the cons that is C load of previous stage cell and big size of chip. is that all about cons?
in other words, is the reason why we use the unit drive strength cell(1x) that Cload and size?

If you are thinking purely from timing perspective, then yes, this is the only cons. And this can, in fact, increase the delay of overall path as well.
On the other hand, increasing the drive strength increases area and power both due to big size and large current flowing in bigger drive strength cell.

I have 2 questions.
1) if the load is itself another inv, because i have 2 of them in series, the RC will be the same for both drive strengths, correct? if claod = cint I have: R(2Cint) for the first and R/2(4Cint) for the second.
2) how can you modify this model if for example, other than Cload, there is the Resistance of the wire going from the output of the inv to Cload to be considered as well? I mean a series resistance between Cint and Cload. What would be the impact of two different drive strengths in this case?

Hi
1\. Correct for this
2\. If there is a resistance as well, then it will become a lot complex. Then, it will have to be broken into 2 parts.
a. cell delay -> which will be derived from "effective capacitance as seen at cell output node. This is how timing tools calculate cell delays
b. Net delay -> This can be calculated with different net delay modes, example Elmore delay model

### 6. Why setup is checked on next edge and hold on same edge? Setup and hold – the state machines essentials

**Date:** 2017-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/11/setuphold-state-machines-essentials.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/11/setuphold-state-machines-essentials.html)

### Why setup is checked on next edge and hold on same edge? Setup and hold – the state machines essentials
Hi friends, in the post [State machines – a practical perspective](http://verisoc.blogspot.in/2015/02/state-machines.html), we learnt about state machines. We also discussed different aspects of a state machine with the help of an example and the need of setup and hold checks to be taken care of. In this post, we will be discussing the state machine with a pinch of setup and hold and try to build a better understanding regarding these. For recapitalization, see figure 1. Each clock edge in a digital state machine represents a state. At each clock edge, all the registers in the design update their value based upon the data available at their input which is based upon the value computed on the basis of values launched by some other registers at previous clock edge. In simplest of words, state 3 is dependent upon state 2, which, in turn, is dependent upon state 1 and so on.
|     |
| [![Each state of a state machine can be represented by a clock pulse](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghi70iVnBdlD4m08qduAgSJCzDbe7JHPPnf-Y7x_HIhECtnLuzRDqhuL6IryHcN_pK4-_uxTR4wQSMR3_oNIviGvAXn59CxiNH602ueeiG4ivf9OLuQY8BfObSYaeg-cvAsFNCO24h6xM/s1600/state+machine+representation+of+a+clock+pulse.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghi70iVnBdlD4m08qduAgSJCzDbe7JHPPnf-Y7x_HIhECtnLuzRDqhuL6IryHcN_pK4-_uxTR4wQSMR3_oNIviGvAXn59CxiNH602ueeiG4ivf9OLuQY8BfObSYaeg-cvAsFNCO24h6xM/s1600/state+machine+representation+of+a+clock+pulse.png) |
| **Figure 1: State machine representation of a clock pulse** |
All digital systems are synchronous systems (state machines) that require all the elements of the state machine to be in harmony. For instance, let us say, a state machine has 100 registers. All these registers need to be updated at the same time and need synchronized inputs so as to have only valid states in the state machines. For digital synchronous state machines, all the registers are synchronized by a clock signal. This is ensured with the help of setup and hold checks. But why do we need to apply setup and hold checks, is the question still unanswered.
**Why setup and hold**? We often encounter people saying that meeting the setup and hold requirements of a design is critical for silicon functionality. But have you ever thought why it is so? As we now know from our previous post, for a design consisting of only positive edge-triggered registers, each positive clock edge corresponds to a state and the state of the machine is updated at every clock edge since all the flip-flops capture data. In other words, the state of the machine is a function of the values of the registers at a particular clock cycle. **For proper state machine functioning, the values launched from one register at one clock edge should be available at the input of the capturing flop before next clock edge arrives and should be available only after the present clock edge has passed (will become clear later on).** This is necessary in order that the next state of the state machine is a valid state. If this does not happen, the state of the machine will not be what is desired. It may also happen that the state machine goes altogether into an invalid state leading to undesired results. And this is the reason setup is checked on the next edge and hold on same edge as discussed below.
Let us assume a hypothetical state machine consisting of three registers and some logic gates as shown in figure 2 below. If we assume the initial outputs of REG1 and REG2 to be 1 and 0 respectively, then the possible states can only be 100 or 010.
|     |
| [![The shown state machine consists of three registers](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCkog95UrswNyCFTREPi7Db3djESOb4z242Paxee_7jrqBDYAIh6A2QPMX-bynbnG0suFaTNVSEJ1XKXNt-otnB95i7T_yh4t210FdNip0j0QjyydHodHzJ8-ZHEhvIUcM9uPhFTNJq_Q/s1600/a+sample+state+machine.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCkog95UrswNyCFTREPi7Db3djESOb4z242Paxee_7jrqBDYAIh6A2QPMX-bynbnG0suFaTNVSEJ1XKXNt-otnB95i7T_yh4t210FdNip0j0QjyydHodHzJ8-ZHEhvIUcM9uPhFTNJq_Q/s1600/a+sample+state+machine.png) |
| **Figure 2: A state machine with three registers and some logic** |
The state transition table for this state machine is as shown in figure 2. As is shown, there are only two valid states (100 and 010) provided the initial state of REG1 and REG2 is different (10 or 01). The state of REG3 is supposed to remain always ‘0’ as the REG1 and REG2 are supposed to always have different values at a time (given initial condition is also this).

| **Figure 3: State diagram of state machine shown in figure 2** |
The states with respect to clock waveform are as shown in figure 4 below. As is expected, each clock edge corresponds to one of the two states.
|     |

| **Figure 4: Clock waveforms showing different states of state machine** |
Now, the state of register 2 at a particular state (clock edge) depends upon state of register 1 at the previous clock edge. Let us assume register 2 is getting delayed clock with respect to register 1. In other words, there is considerable positive skew between the two registers. In this case, as shown in figure 5 below, there is a good chance that the data launched from register 1 is captured at register 2 at the same edge and not the next clock edge. Due to this, both register 1 and 2 will have same value at a particular clock cycle and the machine will run into invalid state. The data getting captured at the same edge as the launch flop is termed as hold violation (unless it is architecturally intended, the discussion of this is outside the scope of this topic).
|     |
| [![The hold violation results due to data being captured on the same edge as it is launched on](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLjAwRJuCHRaNFd5YIMl20FxRQy9Bc21aQcroitZKWpqRz3c7QgnLgO4XvjgZZDT-WVXn4VmO88bbjD0w10cky8LeJvKsKTqnBneiJgjepW48FcT4vPWknHwuhnB7lmHmhCQnCtNeQd4g/s1600/hold+violation.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLjAwRJuCHRaNFd5YIMl20FxRQy9Bc21aQcroitZKWpqRz3c7QgnLgO4XvjgZZDT-WVXn4VmO88bbjD0w10cky8LeJvKsKTqnBneiJgjepW48FcT4vPWknHwuhnB7lmHmhCQnCtNeQd4g/s1600/hold+violation.png) |
| **Figure 5: Hold violation resulting in state machine going to invalid state** |
Similarly, for the proper functioning of the state machine, the data launched at one edge should get captured at the next edge. This is what is termed as setup check. Thus, setup check is formed on next edge only. The failure in happening so is termed as a setup violation. Similarly, the data launched at one edge should not be captured on the same edge. Thus, hold check represents this situation and ensures that the data launched on one edge is not captured on the same edge.
Based upon development of our understanding in this post, setup and hold can be defined as:
**Setup check**: Setup check refers to the condition in which data launched at one clock edge should get captured at the next clock edge so that the state machine functionality is preserved and the state machine transitions smoothly from one state to the next. The failure in happening so is termed as setup violation and the state machine might transition to an invalid state.
**Hold check**: Hold check refers to the condition in which data launched at one clock edge should not get captured at the same clock edge so that present state of the state machine does not get corrupt. The failure in happening so is termed as hold violation and the state machine might transition to an invalid state.

In the above diagram there is only one valid state,if we start with reg1=1,reg2=0 then these values exist for indefinite time i,e the sytem will remain at state 100,it will never transition to state 010.So the state diagram mentioned above is wrong.

They have clearly mentioned that all possible values... I believe there is an input coming to this which is not shown in diagram.

### 7. What is meant by drive strength of a standard cell

**Date:** 2017-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/11/what-is-meant-by-drive-strength-of.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/11/what-is-meant-by-drive-strength-of.html)

### What is meant by drive strength of a standard cell
As we know that cell delay is a function of output load capacitance. The most simplistic equivalent circuit of a logic gate driving an output can be assumed as given in figure 1:
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhapiMMqAXB1stxifh8P_lrjtaEqQTdHDRouEHnHVFMNc2nFAO_X7f-oSgQnju9H4Xw9QLQ4BqkjNWJMUDC1svmQxrkq6GT_seL86Rwt0nl7cux9MaWI5wKBf-u_PbuOhLJeP9KAq14dE9R/s320/cell+driving+a+load.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhapiMMqAXB1stxifh8P_lrjtaEqQTdHDRouEHnHVFMNc2nFAO_X7f-oSgQnju9H4Xw9QLQ4BqkjNWJMUDC1svmQxrkq6GT_seL86Rwt0nl7cux9MaWI5wKBf-u_PbuOhLJeP9KAq14dE9R/s1600/cell+driving+a+load.png)
The purpose of logic gate is to propagate the effect of logic value available at its input to the output. Based upon whether '0' or '1' is to be propagated to the output. The corresponding is achieved by charging and discharging of the output load capacitance. Propagating a logic '0' will mean discharging of the load capacitance, and vice-versa. Drive strength of the logic gate is the its relative capability to charge/discharge the capacitance present at its output. Now, the time constant, and hence, delay of the circuit is "RC".
So, for a cell with higher drive strength, corresponding "R" is lesser than the one with lower drive strength. So that for same load capacitance "C", delay is lower for a cell with higher drive strength as it can charge the capacitance in lesser time.
**How drive strength varies with size of a cell**: Let us talk in terms of MOSFETs, although this is valid in terms of every device in general. We know that for a given technology standard cell library, length of all transistors is kept constant. For instance, 90 nm technology will have gate length of all transistors as ~90 nm. And channel resistance of the MOSFET is inversely proportional to "W/L" of the transistor. So, a simple way to decrease channel resistance is to increase "W" of the transistor. So, a transistor with more area will have lesser resistance. Or we can say that a logic gate with bigger transistors will have more drive strength.
**What is unit drive strength**: In a standard cell library, we generally see cells labelled as "1X", "2X" and so on. But what is meant by the number that you see with drive strength? In general, the lowest size logic gate is labelled as unit drive strength. The drive strength numbers of other cells are laelled relative to unit drive strength cell.

Hello. I have some question. Generally, you said that drive strength increases when the cell size increases, but NORx0 and NORx1 in the saed 28/32 library have the same layout area. Why is the drive strength different in this case?

Hi
I think this may be due to the area required for wires inside the standard cell. For a 1X cell vs 2X cell, the number of wires will be constant. The actual transistor area must be less for x0 cell. You can confirm this by looking at power numbers (power will be less for lesser transistor sizes) and the actual layout (or DEF) view of the standard cell.

Hi, Size of transistor increases means the W of active poly gate is increasing, that doesn't mean area/size of std cell will increase. If you check the GDS for x0 & x1 the OD (overlap over active poly) sizes will be different. for eg. for x0 if OD width is 0.1u , for X1 it will be doubled ~0.2u. Size of cell depends on DRC requirement. Hope this answers your question

Hi,
We see something like 10x5 or 4x5 in the standard cell name, please let me know what does x5 mean ? what I understand 10x or 4x indicates drive strength.

Hi
The nomenclature is highly dependent upon vendor, you can refer documentation for details.

that may be true, but there can be other things as well; which can be highly specific to the library. We cannot generalize this.

### 8. Design problem: How can you convert an XOR gate into a buffer or an inverter?

**Date:** 2017-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/11/design-problem-how-can-you-convert-xor.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/11/design-problem-how-can-you-convert-xor.html)

### Design problem: How can you convert an XOR gate into a buffer or an inverter?
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEieq0hHTD_krbQNN0m0vEj19zvA0OS7UfpeRvK8u9k5EwmRwZu-iGJxdLvUa3dq5s4yIrGQy8PDOpnTKeu9-hMt9xqP70JeiOt0sCP6UYluQq33z52X4ixYS2X6qdvbBUuYkV7Ywglfh6kK/s640/XOR+truth+table.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEieq0hHTD_krbQNN0m0vEj19zvA0OS7UfpeRvK8u9k5EwmRwZu-iGJxdLvUa3dq5s4yIrGQy8PDOpnTKeu9-hMt9xqP70JeiOt0sCP6UYluQq33z52X4ixYS2X6qdvbBUuYkV7Ywglfh6kK/s1600/XOR+truth+table.png)
Figure 1 above shows the truth table of a 2-input XOR gate. It has two inputs A, B and an output OUT. On looking closely, we observe that:
- If one of the inputs (say B) is 0, OUT is equal to the other input. For instance, when B = 0,
  - OUT = 0 when A = 0
  - OUT = 1 when A = 1
- Similarly, if one of the inputs is 1, OUT is equal to invert of the other input. For instance, when B = 1,
  - OUT = 1 when A = 0
  - OUT = 0 when A = 1
Using the above information, XOR gate can be easily converted to a buffer and an inverter.
**Buffer using XOR gate**: Simply connecting one of the inputs to logic '0' will convert XOR gate into a buffer. As shown in the truth table below, OUT is following the value of B.

**Inverter design using XOR gate**: Similarly, we can realize an inverter using an XOR gate by connecting one of the inputs to logic '1'. As shown in the truth table below, OUT is opposite to the value of B.

### 9. Minimum pulse width violation example

**Date:** 2017-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/11/minimum-pulse-width-violation-example.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/11/minimum-pulse-width-violation-example.html)

### Minimum pulse width violation example
**STA problem: Consider below figure, wherein minimum pulse width requirement of a flip-flop is 590 ps. It is getting clocked by a PLL of 500 MHz with a duty cycle variation of 60 ps. There are 30 buffers in clock path, each having a rise delay of 60 ps and fall delay of 48 ps. Will this setup be able to meet the duty cycle requirement of flip-flop? Find the slack available.**
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEJXKq7nsYbu5t1tplk3bFAPc6Yt9UMT_EmJLbUMgzQe2HmbiwTcRDGxGMwt2g5JHWJSsRJtq0gbK809-npiGdcTTjkNajuuMmQF1ER_mWWPRRgvpfZIndz_NGaZmS4MVxuqSPzGXaHmJs/s640/pulse_width_examp%253Be.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEJXKq7nsYbu5t1tplk3bFAPc6Yt9UMT_EmJLbUMgzQe2HmbiwTcRDGxGMwt2g5JHWJSsRJtq0gbK809-npiGdcTTjkNajuuMmQF1ER_mWWPRRgvpfZIndz_NGaZmS4MVxuqSPzGXaHmJs/s1600/pulse_width_examp%253Be.png)
Solution:
Here, we must remember that pulse can be either high pulse or low pulse. So, we need to check for both. Let us start with high pulse:
**Pulse width check for high pulse**: Here, we are left with calculating the latest possible arrival of rising edge and earliest possible arrival of falling edge at the flip-flop. It is given that
Ideal clock period = 2000 ps (500 MHz frequency)
Ideal half cycle = 1000 ps
Duty cycle variation of clock source = 60 ps
So, if we assume that positive edge of the clock has arrived at 0 time, negative edge can arrive at any time between 940 ps (1000 - 60) and 1060 ps (1000 + 60). Taking the pessimistic case, we have to assume negative edge arrives at 940 ps thereby making the high pulse as 940 ps at clock source.
Now, there are 30 buffers with rise delay of 60 ps and fall delay of 48 ps.
Rising edge will reach flip-flop at time (0 + 30 \* 60) = 1800 ps.
Falling edge will reach flip-flop at time (940 + 30 \* 48) = 2380 ps
Effective pulse width visible at flip-flop = 2380 - 1800 = 580 ps
Now, the pulse width requirement = 590 ps
Slack = Actual pulse width = Required minimum pulse width = -10 ps
So, we are violating the minimum high pulse width requirement by 10 ps.
**Pulse width requirement for low pulse**: Similar to the earlier case, we have to find the difference in arrival of latest negative edge and earliest positive edge.
Ideal clock period = 2000 ps (500 MHz)
Ideal half cycle = 1000 ps
Duty cycle variation of clock source = 60 ps
If we assume that negative edge arrived at 0 ps, positive edge can arrive at any time between 940 ps and 1060 ps. Taking the pessimistic case, low pulse width = 940 ps at clock source.
Now, there are 30 buffers with rise delay of 60 ps and fall delay of 48 ps.
Falling edge will reach flip-flop at time (0 + 30 \* 48) = 1440 ps
Rising edge will reach flip-flop at time (940 + 60 \* 30) = 2740 ps
Effective pulse width visible at flip-flop = 2740 - 1440 = 1300 ps
Pulse width requirement = 590 ps
Slack = 1300 - 590 = 710 ps
So, we are meeting the low pulse width requirement by 710 ps.

Why 940ps is added only in Falling edge is reaching at FF.....?
why it is not added in Rising edge reaching the FF..?

940 is equal to the pulse width at source (ideal half period - source duty cycle variation). So, if rise edge leaves the source at time "0", fall edge will leave at time 940. Similarly, if we assume that fall edge leaves the source at time "0", rise edge will leave at 940. I hope I was able to answer your query.

### 10. Duty cycle variation

**Date:** 2017-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/10/duty-cycle-variation.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/10/duty-cycle-variation.html)

### Duty cycle variation
**Duty cycle variation**: Similar to jitter in clock period, there can be variations in duty cycle of the clock source due to uncertainty in the relative timings of positive and negative edges. Duty cycle variation is always measured with respect to corresponding positive and negative edges. In other words, we can also say that duty cycle variation is the uncertainty in arrival of negative edge, given that positive edge has arrived at certain fixed point of time. Let us take an example. If we are given a clock with a period of 10 ns with ideal 50% duty cycle. Also, we are given that it has the clock has a duty cycle variation of +-5%. So, if we say that we saw positive edge of clock at 100 ns, we can expect to see negative edge of clock at any time between 14.5 ns and 15.5 ns. The timing waveform in figure 2 illustrates this.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDv2N2gp5Vve3RRsBQhhFySZd6NjFRxxN4Q0o1wF_AJOiGG54oBY3ZbWYD_YeuZXANYIx9dmKKceJ_VxaG53oe1cqrsoDVmjU3WEHXIIb0UB8QvIyGhFqhWrPBkHelTBax4k0nliNtVDMR/s640/duty+cycle.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDv2N2gp5Vve3RRsBQhhFySZd6NjFRxxN4Q0o1wF_AJOiGG54oBY3ZbWYD_YeuZXANYIx9dmKKceJ_VxaG53oe1cqrsoDVmjU3WEHXIIb0UB8QvIyGhFqhWrPBkHelTBax4k0nliNtVDMR/s1600/duty+cycle.png)
Similarly, if we know with certainty, the point of arrival of negative edge, there will be uncertainty in the time of arrival of positive edge of the clock.
**Applying duty cycle variation**: There may be specific command in STA tools to specify duty cycle variation of a clock. If that is available, you just need to specify duty cycle variation of the master clock source. And all the above discussed cases will be taken care automatically by the tool. If not, it can be applied with the help of SDC command "set\_clock\_uncertainty". For instance, to apply duty cycle variation for a clock named " **clk**" of 0.5 ns, we can apply following commands:
> set\_clock\_uncertainty -rise\_from **clk** -fall\_to **clk** 0.5 -setup
> set\_clock\_uncertainty -fall\_from **clk** -rise\_to **clk** 0.5 -setup
> set\_clock\_uncertainty -rise\_from **clk** -fall\_to **clk** 0.5 -hold
> set\_clock\_uncertainty -fall\_from **clk** -rise\_to **clk** 0.5 -hold
Note that there are two commands that need to be applied as there are two categories of half cycle paths, rise-fall and fall-rise.
**Timing implication of duty cycle variation**: The same way as clock period jitter impacts setup slack of full cycle timing paths; duty cycle variation plays a role in half cycle timing paths. That is why, duty cycle variation is also referred as **half cycle jitter**. Keeping in mind that there are a lot of cases available with divided and undivided clocks, we will discuss below how to apply duty cycle variation while calculating timing slack. We need to keep in mind that, simlar to full cycle jitter, duty cycle variation is the property of a clock source. With reference to duty cycle variation, there can be following categories of clocks.
- Master clock
- Even divided clocks from master clock with 50% duty cycle
- Odd divided clocks from master clock with 50% duty cycle
- Even divided clocks from inverted master clock with 50% duty cycle
- Odd divided clocks from inverted master clock with 50% duty cycle
- Non-50% divided clocks/arbitrary divided clocks
Corresponding to these clock categories, there will be multiple cases, some or all of which may be present in your design. And depending upon the scenario, you may need to apply clock uncertainty for that particular case. A simple rule of thumb is that we should apply uncertainty for that scenario wherein the timing path involves both rise and fall edges of master clock. Let us discuss all these one by one:
**Intra-clock timing paths**:
**Duty cycle variation of master clock**: For a master clock, there will be a duty cycle variation as specified by the specifications of the clock source. So, if there are half cycle timing paths being formed with respect to this clock, we need to apply clock uncertainty for rise->fall and fall->rise timing paths as suggested by figure below.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgNlyrrIH1BEwgy8zUfZJuqQjqzXEi-6FF_Od8tx3W_mDZK5txwNJcK0RtggkqgpjQtPc-HIbvIwJNE4oxHur5dgPJZJDL0TJPZKSabPkaVushLpPh0ZlKrl0-kaxU_M4gV5cyIfWIJystf/s640/duty_cycle_master.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgNlyrrIH1BEwgy8zUfZJuqQjqzXEi-6FF_Od8tx3W_mDZK5txwNJcK0RtggkqgpjQtPc-HIbvIwJNE4oxHur5dgPJZJDL0TJPZKSabPkaVushLpPh0ZlKrl0-kaxU_M4gV5cyIfWIJystf/s1600/duty_cycle_master.png)
So, the commands that need to be applied are:
> set\_clock\_uncertainty <duty\_cycle\_variation> -rise\_from clk -fall\_to clk (both for setup and hold)
> set\_clock\_uncertainty <duty\_cycle\_variation> -fall\_from clk -rise\_to clk (both for setup and hold)
where <duty\_cycle\_variation> is the duty cycle variation of clock source.
**Duty cycle variation of odd divided clock**: A divided clock with odd division factor with respect to root clock will have its positive edges aligned with respect to positive edge of root clock; and negative edges aligned to negative edges of root clock. Figure below illustrates this. So, if we assume that the positive edge is fixed (and neglecting clock period jitter), we can say that its negative edges have an uncertainty which is equal to that of root clock.

So, we need to apply following commands for duty cycle variations of odd\_div\_clock:
> set\_clock\_uncertainty <duty\_cycle\_variation> -rise\_from odd\_div\_clk -fall\_to odd\_div\_clk
> set\_clock\_uncertainty <duty\_cycle\_variation> -fall\_from odd\_div\_clk -rise\_to odd\_div\_clk
**Duty cycle variation of even 50% divided clock**: A divided clock with even division factor with respect to root clock will have both its positive and negative edges aligned to positive edge of root clock. Figure below illustrates this. So, for all the intra-clock paths being formed at this clock, duty cycle variation does not apply. This is one of the reasons why emphasis is given to always have even divided clocks in your design.

**Duty cycle variation of arbitrary divided clocks**: From the basics we have developed so far, duty cycle variation will be applied to a divided clock if its adjacent edges involve both rising and falling edges of the master clock (as in odd divided clocks) and will not be applied if it involves either only positive or only negative edges of root clock.
Figure below shows an example wherein divide-by-2 clock is generated through clock gating cell.  It has a duty cycle of 25%. Here, we need to apply duty cycle variation even as the clock is even divided.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnjLakprA5m6YJ3Uikde5bnawQki3_cW6Y_40tID1OxDfEsqm7OI86-JwyDz9DmqyJZWExDa_1CjtGEQVBlLoJAVkm5ZnrXzomOkCAZ6njZTY7B1ZX1BtbAPNQwbtjHTTrtmw_v3ZOi1hy/s640/duty_cycle_punch_divider.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnjLakprA5m6YJ3Uikde5bnawQki3_cW6Y_40tID1OxDfEsqm7OI86-JwyDz9DmqyJZWExDa_1CjtGEQVBlLoJAVkm5ZnrXzomOkCAZ6njZTY7B1ZX1BtbAPNQwbtjHTTrtmw_v3ZOi1hy/s1600/duty_cycle_punch_divider.png)
Similarly, if an odd divided clock involves only positive or only negative edges of root clock, duty cycle variation will not apply. Figure below shows an example wherein there is a divide-by-3 clock with 33% duty cycle. Here, we dont need to apply duty cycle variation even though the clock is odd divided.

### 11. Duty cycle variation of inter-clock timing paths

**Date:** 2017-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/10/duty-cycle-variation-of-inter-clock.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/10/duty-cycle-variation-of-inter-clock.html)

### Duty cycle variation of inter-clock timing paths
In the post, duty cycle variation, we understood what duty cycle variation is, and how to apply for intra-clock timing paths. But of similar importance is duty cycle variation as applied to inter-clock timing paths. Let us discuss these cases one-by-one:
**Root clock to root-inverted clock**: Inverted clock is same as root clock in frequency, with phase inverted. So, duty cycle variation needs to be applied for following cases:
- Root rise edge -> generated rise edge
- Root fall edge -> generated fall edge
- Generated rise edge -> Root rise edge
- Generated fall edge -> Root fall edge
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMuddsDyfgswA0kzEpxran8WFMxWtCu0BVH6u5ZHxo5NKlZSaYa0YnEsfRys4BAWQj3a26_dIWtkjo9tSlIGUFrrIhwkjQpoV8wP49WPJSVxLus1nLmRufu7xwoODvaOu00OX0yKUf53ax/s640/duty_cycle_root_to_inverted.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMuddsDyfgswA0kzEpxran8WFMxWtCu0BVH6u5ZHxo5NKlZSaYa0YnEsfRys4BAWQj3a26_dIWtkjo9tSlIGUFrrIhwkjQpoV8wP49WPJSVxLus1nLmRufu7xwoODvaOu00OX0yKUf53ax/s1600/duty_cycle_root_to_inverted.png)
Following commands will be needed to be applied:
> set\_clock\_uncertainty -rise\_from root\_clk -rise\_to gen\_clk <duty\_cycle>
> set\_clock\_uncertainty -fall\_from root\_clk -fall\_to gen\_clk <duty\_cycle>
> set\_clock\_uncertainty -rise\_from gen\_clk -rise\_to root\_clk <duty\_cycle>
> set\_clock\_uncertainty -fall\_from gen\_clk -fall\_to root\_clk <duty\_cycle>
**Root clock to odd 50% divided clock:** In this scenario, we need to apply extra uncertainty for the following cases:
- Root rise edge -> Generated fall edge
- Root fall edge -> Generated rise edge
- Generated rise edge -> Root fall edge
- Generated fall edge -> Root rise edge
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-jg_M1z7BeEy3ZyuWhyw1F8z5-630_DgTpNqBG9wjNhsQtY6heBsFGLmXxzBMGX61aq71MgjMzORXDJASAA5gJgVztZ_dAU6onujHFY9bGXb3uUhL9htd7mpTuQrzJitYvEHmmiaSxDei/s640/duty_cycle_root_to_odd_div.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-jg_M1z7BeEy3ZyuWhyw1F8z5-630_DgTpNqBG9wjNhsQtY6heBsFGLmXxzBMGX61aq71MgjMzORXDJASAA5gJgVztZ_dAU6onujHFY9bGXb3uUhL9htd7mpTuQrzJitYvEHmmiaSxDei/s1600/duty_cycle_root_to_odd_div.png)
Following commands will need to be applied for this case:
> set\_clock\_uncertainty -rise\_from root\_clk -fall\_to gen\_clk <duty cycle>
> set\_clock\_uncertainty -fall\_from root\_clk -rise\_to gen\_clk <duty cycle>
> set\_clock\_uncertainty -rise\_from gen\_clk -fall\_to root\_clk <duty cycle>
> set\_clock\_uncertainty -fall\_from gen\_clk -rise\_to root\_clk <duty cycle>
**Root clock to even 50% divided clock**: In this case, we need to apply duty cycle uncertainty for the following cases:
- Root fall edge -> Generated rise edge
- Root fall edge -> Generated fall edge
- Generated rise edge -> Root fall edge
- Generated fall edge -> Root fall edge
Below figure shows these cases for a 50% divided clock from root clock.

So, the rule of thumb is same. Wherever there is a timing path wherein both rising and falling edges of root clock are involved, duty cycle variation will come into play. If you just keep this basic thing into mind, duty cycle variation will never haunt you. :-)

Hello, I read the intra clock and inter clock duty cycle variation topics.
I've understood why for "Duty cycle variation of even 50% divided clock" the duty cycle variation is not applied, it is because both positive and negative edges if divided clock are aligned with positive edge of master clock.
But in case "interclock" duty cycle variation for the case "Root clock to even 50% divided clock", the positive and negative edge of divided clock aligns with positive edge of root clock, then why is duty cycle variation applied in this case?

You said everything right, positive and negative edges of divided clock align with positive edge of root clock.
But negative edge of root clock does not align with any edge of divided clock, so any path between negative edge of root clock and any edge of divided clock should have duty cycle variation being considered as a margin.

In the last example, both positive and negative edge of generated clock align with positive edge of root clock. As per article " duty cycle variation" there should not be any duty cycle variation applied here. how is inter-clock v/s intra-clock spec playing a role here ?

Hi
You are partially right, there can be following cases:
1\. No intra-clock duty cycle variation for generated clock, since only positive edges of root clock are referenced.
2\. No inter-clock duty cycle variation from/to positive edge of root clock to/from generated clock.
3\. But cases where negative edge of root clock is involved, we need to take into account duty cycle variation.
I hope I was able to answer your query.

### 12. Duty cycle degradation

**Date:** 2017-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/10/duty-cycle-degradation.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/10/duty-cycle-degradation.html)

### Duty cycle degradation
In the post, we discussed about duty cycle variation of the clock source. However, this is not the only pain in half cycle timing paths. Along clock path also, duty cycle of the clock can degrade. This can effect timing of half cycle paths adversely. We will discuss this in some detail; and also discuss how to tackle this.
**How is there degradation in duty cycle of clock**: In addition to source duty cycle variation, there can be assymmetry in rise delay vs fall delay of clock elements. For instance, a buffer may have nominal rise (0 -> 1) delay of 50 ns whereas 48 ns for fall delay (1 -> 0). So, if a clock pulse passes through it, it will eat a portion of this clock pulse as shown in figure 1 below. For more clarity, we have exaggerated the scenario with a fall delay of 30 ns.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHNIqHMRIJvjiFp_ITQPEkiFjznonxSFnbrztDjIJEGL5Sbd0iK_gUY5uw_-ck2U5g27oIs0cyPMMdVOQY7ckaYff8u5_jnz5WvOl8AKdHEsWJ5Yjp0SZNTMfb2lmral1nPZ5lMiarAN7r/s640/duty_cycle_degradation.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHNIqHMRIJvjiFp_ITQPEkiFjznonxSFnbrztDjIJEGL5Sbd0iK_gUY5uw_-ck2U5g27oIs0cyPMMdVOQY7ckaYff8u5_jnz5WvOl8AKdHEsWJ5Yjp0SZNTMfb2lmral1nPZ5lMiarAN7r/s1600/duty_cycle_degradation.png)
There are a lot of delay elements in clock distribution networks (also called clock tree network) inside the SoC. So, this problem is bound to happen there. Let us say, clock path has 20 buffers, each having a rise delay 10 ps greater than fall delay. So, the high pulse will get shortened when the clock reaches its sink. See how the pulse gets shortened if there is asymmetry in rise vs fall delay of a delay element or logic gate in below figure.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMWcX34nY_A0cw1D-Ewc1V6S38cPjsNWPUqHlysuS4VQd63kE78wEhxUJI5uaw0oFXEkwAnIpoepMfZedQ_-4nRnRwUGMPZzDkxD7LTLLK7NERSqRXUsabWDs0CfwCJY188tMcS8-cV6j0/s640/duty_cycle_degradation_1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMWcX34nY_A0cw1D-Ewc1V6S38cPjsNWPUqHlysuS4VQd63kE78wEhxUJI5uaw0oFXEkwAnIpoepMfZedQ_-4nRnRwUGMPZzDkxD7LTLLK7NERSqRXUsabWDs0CfwCJY188tMcS8-cV6j0/s1600/duty_cycle_degradation_1.png)
Even if we assume that the delay element has rise delay equal to fall delay, still, there is possibility of duty cycle degradation. Normally, a buffer (or inverter) has a nominal delay with some delay variations (for instance, OCVs) to be taken into account. For instance, it may have a rise delay of 100 ps with OCV variation to be taken of 5%. So, depending upon the scenario, we need to take its delay as either 95 ps or 105 ps. Similarly, even if we say that fall delay is exactly equal to rise delay, even then because of OCV variations, fall delay to be taken into account will be different than rise delay. Let us suppose, there are 20 such buffers in clock path with an ideal clock source. Then, we will have uncertainty in arrival of both rise and fall edges. And the effect will be visible in timing paths' slack.

**How duty cycle degradation impacts timing**: Degradation in duty cycle impacts timing wherever both rising and falling edges of clock are involved. For instance, it will impact half cycle timing paths as well as minimum pulse width check. You can go through our post [duty cycle of clock](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2017/09/duty-cycle-of-clock.html) to have an idea of the impact.

### 13. How to fix min pulse width violation

**Date:** 2017-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/10/improving-duty-cycle-of-clock.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/10/improving-duty-cycle-of-clock.html)

### How to fix min pulse width violation
In our previous posts, we discussed about the duty cycle, duty cycle variation and duty cycle degradation. Bad duty cycle impacts half cycle timing paths and has impact in meeting timing for minimum pulse width checks of flip-flops. However, there are certain techniques available that can help you in improving the duty cycle of the clock. We will discuss these techniques in this post as below:
1\. **Dual inversion in clock branch**: A certain category of logic cells are more probable of having one of the rise or fall delays greater than the other. A chain of such cells will make either high pulse of clock shorter or low pulse of clock shorter. One can use an inverter in the middle of the chain as shown in figure below to tackle this. Doing this, what we are essentially doing is converting rise edges to fall and vice-versa. So, the shortening of pulse of first few elements is balanced with the rest of the elements. In the below figure, there are 20 buffers, each shortening the pulse by 10 ps. The output of 10th buffer will have a shorter pulse as compared to clock source. The inverter at the output of 10th buffer will feed an inverted clock to 11th buffer. This will have high pulse which is greater than low pulse. Rest of the chain will try to reduce this pulse. In the end, we get a pulse which is equal to what was available at the source.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0yW8-xOIzQNJ-G7QAV-K-ZuTcrJYKtkNheV8ddG6NFjZyJfbHLI1OQR0rbOL-zqdS5SZm0KxWLxYp3ui3bEggIW1-gT02DWU_pOAlVU1RfCXN6NtbwjdlOtekrX3SxgcuTnztWzjMlKvm/s640/duty_cycle_improvement_1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0yW8-xOIzQNJ-G7QAV-K-ZuTcrJYKtkNheV8ddG6NFjZyJfbHLI1OQR0rbOL-zqdS5SZm0KxWLxYp3ui3bEggIW1-gT02DWU_pOAlVU1RfCXN6NtbwjdlOtekrX3SxgcuTnztWzjMlKvm/s1600/duty_cycle_improvement_1.png)
One can also try an all-inverter clock tree. In an all-inverter clock tree, every element will change the sense of clock pulse; thereby minimizing the clock pulse distortion.
However, this kind of delay balancing will only work where there is inherent variation of delays in rise vs fall. It will not work in case of OCV variations. So, if the chain length is arbitrarily large, our second method will come to rescue.
2\. **Even division to tackle duty cycle degradation**: Suppose there is source clock with very poor duty cycle (say 10%) and you divide down the clock by 2 with a flip-flop divider. What we observe is amazing. The resulting clock is having almost 50% duty cycle. So, whenever we need an output clock with perfect duty cycle, we can use a divider to divide down the clock. The only drawback of this method is that we need a source clock of frequency twice than what is required to be timed!!
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3C6tqm0lYVvayYKTM-vkb7m5f_nRWI8NTBNH5Si2HbjaaWxHUl_UpD-muqHjQ3l7jChPsfgB4YrFXoe5yTMNNqvjRXC2tU5RcE77C7TreiKMxngwhHtRZJtEGQlkYCh4TT7ROARYyB7Di/s640/duty_cycle_improvement_2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3C6tqm0lYVvayYKTM-vkb7m5f_nRWI8NTBNH5Si2HbjaaWxHUl_UpD-muqHjQ3l7jChPsfgB4YrFXoe5yTMNNqvjRXC2tU5RcE77C7TreiKMxngwhHtRZJtEGQlkYCh4TT7ROARYyB7Di/s1600/duty_cycle_improvement_2.png)
There are a few things to be kept in mind for this method:
- This method will improve the duty cycle of clock at the output of the flop. Degradation in duty cycle happening after the divider, if any, will be there.
- Duty cycle of the input clock at flip-flop must be within the limits of what is required to be minimum pulse width at the flip-flop.

### 14. Glitches in combinational circuits

**Date:** 2017-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/10/glitches-in-combinational-circuits.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/10/glitches-in-combinational-circuits.html)

### Glitches in combinational circuits
**What is a glitch**: As per definition, a glitch is any unwanted pulse at the output of a combinational gate. In other words, a glitch is a small spike that happens at the output of a gate. A glitch happens generally, if the delays to the combinational gate output are not balanced. For instance, consider an AND gate with one of its inputs getting inverted and delayed version of  its other input. It, then will produce a short pulse (or glitch) at the ouput whenever its input goes from zero to one.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEin8MvoLCCDWNyZEqir99WEXFifrEM05t1nRrfTimjkfx1WX_gnWM89-78a-DYEs0GIAF6xTuGwkaApKTJk4zRDNFiK5Re4zlVy1V7aJfMeA6YYqT9JrWLmAkSI8_TIJwdXFsiL2E16WMCN/s640/clock+glitch.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEin8MvoLCCDWNyZEqir99WEXFifrEM05t1nRrfTimjkfx1WX_gnWM89-78a-DYEs0GIAF6xTuGwkaApKTJk4zRDNFiK5Re4zlVy1V7aJfMeA6YYqT9JrWLmAkSI8_TIJwdXFsiL2E16WMCN/s1600/clock+glitch.png)
As also said above, this is due to the fact that the delays to the AND gate through two paths are not balanced. Let us elaborate with the help of below waveform. When input goes from zero to one, the other input will go to zero after some time as there is a delay equal to that of an inverter. Due to this, there will be a glitch at the output of AND gate. It needs to be noted that lesser the delay difference between the two inputs at the input of AND gate, lower will be the duration of glitch.

**How are glitches harmful**? Glitches may be harmful in two ways:
- Timing/functional issue: A glitch can be an issue if it propagates to the resultant logic or gets captured by a flip-flop. There can be two cases here:
- **Synchronous timing paths**: These are timing paths wherein we are required to meet setup and hold timings. So, even if there is a glitch, it will be within the limits of minimum and maximum delays permissible from one flip-flop to another. So, there will be no timing issue provided that you have taken care of setup and hold timings.
- **Asynchronous timing paths**: If the launch and capture clocks do not have any relationship, setup and hold cannot be ensured. So, if there is a glitch in the data path, it can get captured, hence, can cause issue. To prevent this, synchronizers are used and there are certain rules to be followed for asynchronous paths. These are to be followed to ensure that no wrong data gets captured due to clock glitches. It should be better to call this as functional issue as it can be taken care of only architecturally.
- High power!!! Every toggling causes power dissipation due to charging and discharging of gate capacitance. So, a glitch causes power dissipation. Even if there is no timing/functional issue associated with the glitch propagation, power dissipation can be an issue. Larger the combinational path leading to a node, larger the number of probable toggles possible; greater is the expected power dissipation.

### 17. Duty cycle of clock

**Date:** 2017-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/09/duty-cycle-of-clock.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/09/duty-cycle-of-clock.html)

### Duty cycle of clock
**Duty cycle**: Duty cycle of a clock is defined as the fraction of a period of clock during which the clock is in active state. Duty cycle of a clock is normally expressed as a percentage. For instance, figure below shows a clock having an active state of '1' stays low for 2 ns during its period of 10 ns. It is, therefore, said to have a duty cycle of 20%.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3s9BFtX1THE6NmfGgWHEoN1rOiv0z2EWBEa3nxHtSZ9jyu2uTxI6I99oSS3jKWR5RYykvhHeqDH71ffvrJa5uCZ3Pfz8TUUwBtbP1ANjorRHV84v_zLjpFvhlZrA95AsA0wDbaSSPldQb/s640/duty+cycle.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3s9BFtX1THE6NmfGgWHEoN1rOiv0z2EWBEa3nxHtSZ9jyu2uTxI6I99oSS3jKWR5RYykvhHeqDH71ffvrJa5uCZ3Pfz8TUUwBtbP1ANjorRHV84v_zLjpFvhlZrA95AsA0wDbaSSPldQb/s1600/duty+cycle.png)
**How duty cycle impacts timing:** Duty cycle of clock plays a big role in timing closure of designs. We need to consider following factors related to duty cycle variation while timing:
- **Half cycle timing paths**: If there are both positive and negative edge-triggered flip-flops in the design, duty cycle of the clock matters a lot. For instance, if we have a clock of 100 MHz with 20% duty cycle; For a timing path from positive edge-triggered flip-flop to negative edge-triggered flip-flop, we get only 2 ns for setup timing for positive-to-negative path and 8 ns for negative-to-positive path as compared to 10 ns for a full cycle path. However, if the same clock had duty cycle of 50%, we would have got 5 ns for the same half cycle timng path.

- **Minimum pulse width requirements**: At high frequencies, duty cycle matters a lot. For instance, every sequential element has requirement of minimum pulse width that should reach it ( [read this](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2016/09/min-pulse-width-check.html)). If the duty cycle of the clock is not close to 50%, we are limited in providing high frequency even if we are capable of meeting timing at even higher frequencies. Let us take an example. If the minimum pulse width requirement of a flip-flop is 500 ps, then with 50% duty cycle clock, we can use a clock of 1 GHz (1 ns clock period). But if we use a clock of duty cycle of 20%, we cannot use a clock greater than 400 MHz.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiARqAHVkFfyNXdRvgbEcYmm6Z9WHGWzXC0NQNISyqrwMd6Tzs7bXLOehtpUpr6ZuRBVuXqXoH50IXuC-7zSJGq2_ojqxjKpqnGbrkA5zVom6mSO8VoCTGrTG0V70mbj_s7UIbwUMUuIZFr/s640/duty+cycle2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiARqAHVkFfyNXdRvgbEcYmm6Z9WHGWzXC0NQNISyqrwMd6Tzs7bXLOehtpUpr6ZuRBVuXqXoH50IXuC-7zSJGq2_ojqxjKpqnGbrkA5zVom6mSO8VoCTGrTG0V70mbj_s7UIbwUMUuIZFr/s1600/duty+cycle2.png)
With the above things in mind, it makes sense to use a clock with duty cycle as close to 50%. However, in many scenarios, it may not be feasible to do so. So, one needs to decide the priorities; i.e., architecture complexities vs timing complexities. Generating a divided clock of 50% duty cycle is not always possible and there are a few complexities involved in architecture. For instance, clock waveform synchronization between the clocks if there are multiple dividers. Also, for odd division factors like divide\_by\_3 etc., we need more complex divider circuitry than what may be required for divide\_by\_2 or divide\_by\_4 etc.

Hi
The flip-flop that is going to consume the clock has a minimum pulse width requirement of 500 ps, so we cannot have a pulse width less than 500 ps. 500 ps is 20% of 2.5 ns, so the clock period must be greater than 2.5 ns. In other words, clock frequency must be less that 400 MHz.

How about duty cycle more than 50%? Since min pulse requirements are met with more than 50%, is duty cycle of 90% allowed? what are the downsides?

Hi
What you are missing here is that there is also a min-pulse-width requirement in the other direction; i.e. there are both high pulse and low pulse requirements. So, if you provide a duty cycle of 90%, it means low pulse is only 10% and most probably will limit the design frequency.

### 18. Clock jitter

**Date:** 2017-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/08/clock-jitter.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/08/clock-jitter.html)

### Clock jitter
**Clock jitter**: By definition, clock jitter is the deviation of a clock edge from its ideal position in time. Simply speaking, it is the inability of a clock source to produce a clock with clean edges. As the clock edge can arrive within a range, the difference between two successive clock edges will determine the instantaneous period for that cycle. So, clock jitter is of importance while talking about timing analysis. There are many causes of jitter including PLL loop noise, power supply ripples, thermal noise, crosstalk between signals etc. Let us elaborate the concept of clock jitter with the help of an example:
A clock source (say PLL) is supposed to provide a clock of frequency 10 MHz, amounting to a clock period of 100 ns. If it was an ideal clock source, the successive rising edges would come at 0 ns, 100 ns, 200 ns, 300 ns and so on. However, since, the PLL is a non-ideal clock source, it will have some uncertainty in producing edges. It may produce edges at 0 ns, 99.9 ns, 201 ns etc. Or we can say that the clock edge may come at any time between (<ideal\_time>+- jitter); i.e. 0, between 99-101 ns, between 199-201 ns etc (1 ns is jitter). However, counting over a number of cycles, average period will come out to be ~100 ns.
Figure 1 below shows the generic diagram for clock jitter:
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhmfzYQkCesEmOX32Eo6Opb5Qv-vvzV7PKWJdaS6bmCrch8Kxu6_LEj8b2cp6LYq_0ojKb4O9NSXNsmNwnFLKzmQ7XKr5c8CQ4Lfz9pscYKNyyjxWv6vu5TvCxco2naN8A1ZTx1V1LDnKAE/s640/clock+jitter.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhmfzYQkCesEmOX32Eo6Opb5Qv-vvzV7PKWJdaS6bmCrch8Kxu6_LEj8b2cp6LYq_0ojKb4O9NSXNsmNwnFLKzmQ7XKr5c8CQ4Lfz9pscYKNyyjxWv6vu5TvCxco2naN8A1ZTx1V1LDnKAE/s1600/clock+jitter.png)
Please note that the uncertainty in clock edge can be for both positive as well as negative edges (above example showed only for positive edges). So, there are both full cycle and half cycle jitters. By convention, clock jitter implies full cycle clock jitter.
**Types of clock jitter**: Clock jitter can be measured in many forms depending upon the type of application. Clock jitter can be categorized into cycle-to-cycle, period jitter and long term jitter.
- **Cycle to cycle jitter**: By definition, cycle-to-cycle jitter signifies the change in clock period accross two consecutive cycles. For instance, it will be difference in periods for 1st and 2nd cycles, difference in periods for 10th and 11th cycles etc. It has nothing to do with frequency variation over time. For instance, in figure below, the clock has drifted in frequency (from period = 10 ns to period = 1 ns), still maintaining a cycle-to-cycle jitter of 0.1 ns. In other words, if t2 and t1 are successive clock periods, then cycle\_to\_cycle\_jitter = (t2 - t1).

- **Period jitter**: It is defined as the "deviation of any clock period with respect to its mean period". In other words, it is the difference between the ideal clock period and the actual clock period. Period jitter can be specified as either RMS period jitter or peak-to-peak period jitter.
  - **Peak-to-peak period jitter**: It is defined as the jitter value measuring the difference between two consecutive edges of clock. For instance, if the ideal period of the clock was 20 ns, then for clock shown above,
    - for first cycle, peak-to-peak period jitter = (20 - 20) = 0 ns
    - for second cycle, peak-to-peak period jitter = (20 - 19.9) = 0.1 ns
    - for last cyle, peak-to-peak period jitter = (20 - 1) = 19 ns
  - **RMS period jitter**: RMS period jitter is simply the root-mean-square of all the peak-to-peak period jitters available.
- **Long term jitter**: Long term jitter is the deviation of the clock edge from its ideal position. For instance, for a clock with period 20 ns, ideally, clock edges should arrive at 20 ns, 40 ns and so on. So, if 10th edge comes at 201 ns, we will say that the long term jitter for 10th edge is 1 ns. Similarly, 1000th edge will have a long term jitter of 0.5 ns if it arrives at 20000.5 ns.
Let us try to understand the difference between all the three kinds of jitter with the help of an illustrative example waveform below:

### 19. Which type of jitter matters for timing slack calculation?

**Date:** 2017-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/08/which-type-of-jitter-matters-for-timing.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/08/which-type-of-jitter-matters-for-timing.html)

### Which type of jitter matters for timing slack calculation?
In the post [Clock jitter](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2017/08/clock-jitter.html), we learnt about the basics of clock jitter. We also learned about different types of clock jitter. Now, the question arises as to what type of clock jitter is useful for calculation of timing slack, both setup and hold slacks. We will gradually try to build understanding for the same.
If we look into the equation of setup slack for a positive edge-triggered flip-flop to another positive edge-triggered flip-flop, we see that setup slack depends upon "clock period". Now, if look closely, we will find that the clock period that we are talking about is actually distance between two clock edges. The larger the distance between the clock edges, greater will be the clock period. Hence, more positive will be setup slack.

Now, period jitter represents the absolute deviation of clock period from its ideal clock period. So, the jitter we should be looking for is maximum value of "peak-to-peak period jitter". Peak-to-peak period jitter can either increase or decrease clock period. But, we need to take the effect of jitter to decrease clock period. This is because we have to take the worst case of clock period to have most pessimistic setup slack value. And the worst clock period will occur when peak-to-peak jitter is maximum.
So, we can say that for setup slack calculation,
> Clock period (actual) = Clock period (ideal) - peak-to-peak jitter (maximum)
**What will happen to clock jitter if I divide down the clock?**
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgv5PpA1C3wBl-67kY0-KQG_JdyagsT0F_ddyVU0-pjd9vecjgsFF0O-WcQpknngZHl5ImsjfBoa2QszPkaabNBwe-tnN9BGKQRWCpB9TZXRQw-kildFLT3DWla0XIkMaAFUiHELLF8kX8l/s320/divided+clocks_1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgv5PpA1C3wBl-67kY0-KQG_JdyagsT0F_ddyVU0-pjd9vecjgsFF0O-WcQpknngZHl5ImsjfBoa2QszPkaabNBwe-tnN9BGKQRWCpB9TZXRQw-kildFLT3DWla0XIkMaAFUiHELLF8kX8l/s1600/divided+clocks_1.png)
As we have discussed above, due to clock jitter, for setup calculation, we will assume that peak-to-peak period jitter has caused edge 2 to come closer to edge 1, thereby reducing actual clock period by that margin. Similarly, edge 3 can come closer to edge 2. So, ideally, if we look at DIV\_2 clock, the possible jitter here should be 2 times the jitter of SOURCE\_CLOCK. Similarly, a DIV\_4 clock is expected to have 4 times the jitter and a DIV\_8 clock is expected to have 8 times the jitter. And so on..
Now comes the tricky part. As per the definition of long term jitter, nth edge of clock cannot have a jitter more than long term jitter. So, if I say that a PLL has a long term jitter spec of 6 times that of maximum peak-to-peak period jitter, then a DIV\_8 clock will have peak-to-peak jitter equal to 6 times the peak-to-peak period jitter of SOURCE\_CLOCK. Even a DIV\_16 clock will have same maximum jitter.
**What will happen to clock jitter for a multicycle path?**
Similar to the case of divided down version of clock, a multicycle path also involves other than consecutive edges. So, similar concepts will apply here. So, a multicycle path for setup of 2 will have a jitter of 2 times the peak-to-peak jitter of SOURCE\_CLOCK, etc.

Hi Sir,
During hold violation calculation, we needs to consider decrease in clock period due to jitter right?

Hi
Whenever there is zero cycle check, we do not need to take into account jitter. Normally, hold check is zero cycle, so we dont need to take any type of jitter into account.

### 20. Can jitter in clock effect setup and hold violations?

**Date:** 2017-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/08/can-jitter-in-clock-effect-setup-and.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/08/can-jitter-in-clock-effect-setup-and.html)

### Can jitter in clock effect setup and hold violations?
First of all, we need to understand what is meant by jitter. In most simplistic language, jitter is the uncertainty of a clock source in production of clock edges. For example, if we say that there is a 100 MHz clock source. Ideally, it should produce a clock edge at 0 ns, 10 ns, 20 ns... So, if we say that there was a clock edge at time t = 30 ns, we should get the next clock edge at t = 40 ns. But this is hardly so; due to the uncertainty of getting a clock edge, we might get the next edge between 39.9 ns to 40.1 ns. So, we say that 0.1 ns is the jitter in the period of the clock. In reality, the definition of jitter is more complex. But, for our scope, this understanding is sufficient.
Let us consider a simple timing path from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop to a positive edge-triggered flip-flop.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2P3jMbTmlN4SspL7jAIPH95Z8aBRSPlezZRJr1S3lDjsWEdHhCBtM8wU5S3xWNs7rc45uOp1v1rLr0Crp-dXCDLecw-MhEU9QMJWj3KLalbN5g3k_8SmGVIzgNSmOTR1qZRYwPftOM1wq/s320/setup+path.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2P3jMbTmlN4SspL7jAIPH95Z8aBRSPlezZRJr1S3lDjsWEdHhCBtM8wU5S3xWNs7rc45uOp1v1rLr0Crp-dXCDLecw-MhEU9QMJWj3KLalbN5g3k_8SmGVIzgNSmOTR1qZRYwPftOM1wq/s1600/setup+path.png)
Now, let us come to our discussion. First, let us discuss the effect of clock jitter on setup slack.
**Effect of clock jitter on setup slack for single cycle paths**: From our knowledge of STA basics, setup check formed, in this case, will be from edge 1 -> edge 3. Now, if we know that edge 1 arrived at 20 ns, then edge 3 may arrive at any time (20 ns + CLOCK\_PERIOD + jitter) and (20 ns + CLOCK\_PERIOD - jitter). So, to cover worst case timing scenario, we need to time as per (20 ns + CLOCK\_PERIOD - jitter). So, effectively, we will get (CLOCK\_PERIOD - jitter) as effective clock period.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiO-hoDqGW0uNFVNyM-e4RzfuZSUmU9nGzLqZpeafNfv4Me9YecvP7W_YNwqPCC3FO495NFDMEQExZVP4QusZQmMBEA1Q4BXc8fyux1hgfbMMWQWZQmOOzkAm5AvvHczthaVEJBEIL7burX/s320/setup_check_with_jitter.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiO-hoDqGW0uNFVNyM-e4RzfuZSUmU9nGzLqZpeafNfv4Me9YecvP7W_YNwqPCC3FO495NFDMEQExZVP4QusZQmMBEA1Q4BXc8fyux1hgfbMMWQWZQmOOzkAm5AvvHczthaVEJBEIL7burX/s1600/setup_check_with_jitter.png)
In other words, jitter in clock period makes the setup timing more tight. Or it decreases setup slack for single cycle timing paths.
**Effect of clock jitter on hold slack for single cycle paths**: Going on the same grounds as setup slack, hold check will be from edge 1 -> edge 1 only. And we know with certainty that edge 1 will leave the source at 20 ns only. So, hold slack should not get bothered by the amount of jitter present at the clock source for single cycle timing paths.
Now, you understand the basics of  how jitter affects setup and hold slacks. We can state as below:
**If the check being formed involves two different edges of same polarity (for instance, different rising edges), then, jitter in clock period will affect setup slack. Otherwise, it will not.**
**Now, can you guess the effect of jitter on setup and hold slacks for zero cycle timing paths?**
**Also, what will be the amount of pessimism needed to be taken into account for setup and hold slacks' calculations if the timing path is a multi-cycle path taking 2 cycles for setup and zero cycle for hold?**

The above statement is wrong. Hold slack is effected by clock jitter.

Can you please share which hold paths are effected by clock jitter? In my understanding since hold is single cycle so it should not be effected.

Hi
Yes, for single cycle paths, hold is on same edge. Hence, it is not effected by clock jitter. But for a zero cycle timing path, hold check is from N to (N-1) edge, hence, slack is affected by clock jitter. You can refer point 3 in https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/04/can-hold-be-frequency-dependant.html.
Also, I recommend you to go through https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/07/is-hold-always-checked-on-same-edge.html
I hope it will be clear now. We can discuss more in case of further queries.

Hi
No, jitter does not affect C2Q delay. C2Q delay depends only on clock pin transition and load seen by Q pin.

Setup gets affected by 2\*jittervalue as 2 edges are involved. both edges experience uncertainty. Launch= original + jitter and for capture=original - jitter. so overall available time= T - 2\*jitter

    Hi Prasanth
    In my opinion, you can prioritize in below order:
    1\. MOSFET questions, MOSFET as a switch, MOSFET as an amplifier etc.
    2\. Flip-flops and frequency divider circuits. FSM basics
    3\. RC, RLC circuits solving
    4\. Control systems
    5\. Microprocessors

    In this below link and in the case 3.What do you mean by design violation? Is that we shouldn't design the system by expecting synchronous data from the launch flop which is driven by same clock but with asynchronous reset. if so what is the alternative take to overcome this kind of handling.

    Hi
    Your statement is valid only when the capturing flip-flop expects data when the launching flip-flop gets reset. We can do either of following in this case:
    1\. The capturing flip-flop should also get into reset state whenever launch flip-flop gets into reset state (they should be driven by same reset synchronizer)
    2\. There should be synchronization mechanism in place so that any probable metastability gets absorbed
    3\. Reset should launch from a synchronous source as we explained in example in case 3

    I had another query, as you mentioned earlier asynchronous reset need not to be timed? right. What, if all the flops of certain blocks is being driven to meta-stable state due to asynchronous reset application. It may not cause any functional issue. But the entire block ( Combinational/sequential) will be in meta-stable state for certain duration which will impact huge power drain or even cause combinational logic to burn (correct my understanding on meta-stability if i'm wrong.

    Hi
    Yes, asynchronous reset assertion does not need to be timed, provided it does not cause any metastability issue as you described. The post I have written is about this issue only. :-) I hope I was able to explain the scenarios well in thata post.
    Also, in addition to large power burn-down, functional issues are also caused by metastability.

    Hi,
    What is glitch in the clock? How does it effects the system and how it arrives.Whether glitch means meta-stable region of clock ?

    Hi,
    whether there is any possibility to use the hold violation of the chip after it is being manufactured ( Post silicon).
    we can fix setup by reducing frequency of operation. similarly for hold issue increasing voltage of operation will it helps?

    Hi
    There are two categories of hold checks:
    1\. Zero cycle hold check: Most of the cases comprise of zero cycle hold check. In this case, if there is a hold violation, slowing the frequency will not help.
    2\. Non-zero cycle hold checks: Here, reducing the frequency helps in hold slack recovery as in setup checks. Hence, in this case, you can use the chip after reducing frequency.

    Hi
    This is because for some of the layers, minimum geometry width is very smaller as compared to the wavelength of light used so that there is a possibility of merging of the two lines drawn. Thus, to make it possible for the light to differentiate between two lines, different masks are used.

### 22. Synchronous and asynchronous resets

**Date:** 2017-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/04/synchronous-and-asynchronous-resets.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/04/synchronous-and-asynchronous-resets.html)

### Synchronous and asynchronous resets
In the post reset basics, we discussed the need of having reset and the strategies used by designers related to reset. One of the decisions that designers need to finalize is to choose synchronous vs asynchronous reset strategy. Each of these reset strategies is capable of achieving the purpose of a reset. A design may also have a mixed approach in which a part of the device is driven by synchronous reset and another part has an asynchronous approach to reset. In this post, we will be discussing the pros and cons of each.
- **Synchronous reset**: If the reset affects the state of the design only on the active edge of the clock, we term it as a synchronous reset signal. A synchronous reset is fed into the D fanin cone of a flip-flop. Figure 1 below shows a sample design with synchronous reset.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQEXGD7CRE0Yp0w2uR28NVLYAp-BFDgpZDaBKU3bFoQRYvPzIB2I4DyNRsq0mMaBfgzD911FyK8hK2lu-zwWBzBolZkwW1wIaxHH-jwup72UUAJVktPLUzEhBNUN56Tjtzahwz2qVjWK2d/s320/synchronous+reset.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQEXGD7CRE0Yp0w2uR28NVLYAp-BFDgpZDaBKU3bFoQRYvPzIB2I4DyNRsq0mMaBfgzD911FyK8hK2lu-zwWBzBolZkwW1wIaxHH-jwup72UUAJVktPLUzEhBNUN56Tjtzahwz2qVjWK2d/s1600/synchronous+reset.png)
> Generally, the reset signal must be closest to the target flip-flop in order to have least number of gates. If the reset of above figure is restructured, one AND gate must be converted to two AND gates to have the reset propagated to the target flip-flop in all situations. But this kind of data path results in increased data path for other critical functional paths. So, synthesis tool needs to take intelligent decision of gate count vs critical signals' timing.
> Synchronous reset generation results in smaller flip-flops, but the combinational gate count grows as reset must be applied through combinational logic only.
> We can afford to have glitches in reset signal as long as it is meeting setup and hold timing. Therefore, if reset signal is generated by a set of internal logic conditions, synchronous reset is the only goto as there will be glitches formed upon mingling of different conditions.
> Reset pulse must be big enough to get captured at the active clock edge target registers. For example, if the register gets launched on a clock of period 5 ns and is targetted for a flip clop receiving a clock of period 20 ns, there is a chance of getting the reset pulse not getting captured. So, there will be a requirement of a pulse stretcher circuit.
> There are further complexities when clock gating is implemented to save power. If the clock is gated, you cannot force the design into reset state. Only asynchronous reset can work in that scenario.
- **Asynchronous reset**: If the reset affects the state of the design asynchronously; i.e., whether or not clock is running, then the design is said to have asynchronous reset.
> For designs with asynchronous reset, datapath is independent of reset signal. So, logic levels in datapath are less. This means that we can achieve higher frequency using asynchronous resets.
> The design can be reset even when clock is gated. Also, no work arounds are needed during synthesis as in case of synchronous resets.
> An asynchronous reset signal needs to be glitch free. Even a small glitch on reset signal can reset the design.
> For a flip-flop with asynchronous reset, assertion of reset resets the flip-flop asynchronously. Deassertion of reset leaves the output of flip-flop unchanged. The state of flip-flop will change only on arrival of next clock pulse. There can be two scenarios:
> 1. **Clock is gated during deassertion of reset**: In this case, we can safely deassert the reset and ungate the clock some time after deassertion.
> 2. **Clock is running during deassertion of reset**: In this case, we need to take care of the recovery/removal timing of deassertion of reset. The deassertion of reset must be synchronous with respect to clock. Reset synchronizers are needed to synchronize the deassertion of reset signal.
> Figure below shows the timing waveform for assertion and deassertion of asynchronous reset. As we can see, the assertion of reset causes the output to go to '0', whereas deassertion waits for the clock edge to arrive and cause the output to change.

### 23. Recovery and removal checks

**Date:** 2017-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/04/recovery-and-removal-checks.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/04/recovery-and-removal-checks.html)

### Recovery and removal checks
Recovery and removal checks are associated with deassertion of asynchronous reset. The assertion of reset causes the output to get reset and deassertion transfers the control of output to clock signal; i.e., deassertion of reset does not change the output as we discussed in post [synchronous and asynchronous resets](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2017/04/synchronous-and-asynchronous-resets.html). However, to ensure that the design comes out of reset in deterministic cycle and to avoid metastability, there must be a region around arrival of clock edge within which reset must not be deasserted. This is similar to setup and hold timing checks, the difference being that:
> **Setup and hold checks are associated with synchronous data signals for a flop and are applied to both rise and fall transitions of data. Recovery and removal checks, on the other hand, are for asynchronous reset transitioning from active state to inactive state only (deassertion of reset).**
To properly understand what recovery and removal checks are, we need to understand what asynchronous reset assertion and deassertion does.
**Asynchronous reset assertion**: In a flip-flop, assertion of reset causes the output to go to its reset value (which is normally "0"). The assertion of reset is an asynchronous event and is not impacted by the state of clock. Figure 1 below depicts the assertion of reset. As it can be seen, Output asynchronously goes to "0" as an effect of reset going to its active state "1".

**Asynchronous reset deassertion**: The deassertion of asynchronous reset causes the output to get out of the impact of reset and behave like a normal flip-flop. When the reset gets deasserted, its output remains to be "0" until the clock edge. When the clock edge arrives, the value at the input of the flop propagates to the output. Figure 2 below depicts the same. However, the position of reset deassertion with respect to clock edge matters here as is the case with setup and hold checks. If the reset toggles in the vicinity of clock edge, the flip-flop may go metastable. This is avoided by defining recovery and removal checks for reset deassertion. For the sake of simplicity, we can say that recovery and removal checks are setup and hold checks for reset deassertion.

**Reset recovery check**: Recovery check ensures that the deasserted reset signal allows the clock signal to take control of the output at the desired clock edge. For this, reset signal must be stable at least " **recovery time**" before the active clock edge. Recovery time is the minimum time required between the deassertion of reset signal and arrival of clock edge. This can be modelled similarly as a setup check with the difference of it being a single sided synchronous check only.
**Reset removal check**: Removal check ensures that the deasserted reset signal does not get captured on the clock edge at which it is launched by reset synchronizer. For this, reset signal must be stable at lease " **removal time**" after the active clock edge. Removal time is the minimum time required after the arrival of clock edge for which reset must not be deasserted at the flop's reset pin. This can be modelled similarly as a hold check with the difference of it being a single sisded synchronous check only.
Figure below shows reset de-assertion as a complete picture and summarises what we have discussed in this post.

Hello Sir, It's an excellent explanation for the concept. I have a doubt. What if Reset Assertion occurs within either the Reset Recovery time or the removal time?

Hi
Reset assertion can occur at any time, there is no relation of reset assertion to either recovery or removal times.
However, if the same question is asked for reset deassertion, then the same thing will happen as what happens when data toggles between setup and hold time window. The flip-flop can either respond to reset deassertion at current edge, or may not respond. Furthermore, there is a possibility that it can go to metastable state.

Dear sir, thank you for the simplified and yet effective explanation. Sir,what is the underlying physics that's responsible for the existence of recovery and removal time?

Hi
In my opinion, this is the simplest explanation. A flip-flop will need some time to change its state on the arrival of clock edge, so data must not change during this window. The position of left edge of this boundary with respect to clock edge is called setup time (recovery time in case of reset signal) and the right edge's position with respect to clock edge is called hold time (removal time in case of reset signal). And the window during which the signal is not allowed to toggle is called setup-hold window.

In many systems resets come from IOs and they are in form of a pulse.
For an active high async reset , the pulse may go low any time.
How is this ensured that reset is not released in recovery of removal time shown in the waveform/figure ?
Thanks for such a great post !

Hi
Nice question, in such cases you use a reset synchronizer. It is a special kind of synchronizer which synchronizes only the deassertion of reset.

Question on this special reset synchronizer. How does it ensure that the reset to this reset-synchronizer comes at right time and does not cause the synchronizer to go into metastability

Hi
Reset synchronizer is designed not to avoid metastability.
It is designed to absorb metastability such that it does not propagate to the flops in the fanout of reset synchronizer.
Reset synchronizer consists of at least two flops is series. (assuming 2 stages), The first stage is allowed to go metastable with the confidence that most of the times its metastability will be resolved in one cycle. Thus, the metastability will not propagate to the 2nd stage with very high probability. In this way, reset synchronizer (or any other synchronizer) absorbs metastability.
In case the probability of propagation of metastability to stage 2 is high, we can use 3-stage reset synchronizer and so on.
I hope it helped you clear your understanding. Please feel free to ask in case of any queries.

"Removal time is the minimum time required between the arrival of clock edge and the deassertion of reset."
sorry sir, but this sentence is confusing, "between the arrival of clock edge and the deassertion of reset" I suppose this described "recovery time"

### 24. Clock multiplexer for glitch-free clock switching

**Date:** 2017-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/clock-multiplexer.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/clock-multiplexer.html)

### Clock multiplexer for glitch-free clock switching
In the post [clock switching and clock gating checks](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2014/05/clock-switching-and-clock-gating-checks.html), we discussed how important it is to have a glitch free clock. Also, in clock gating checks at a multiplexer, we discussed the conditions wherein a normal multiplexer can be used to propagate a clock without any glitches.
In this post, we will discuss about multiplexer circuit for clock switching which can safely switch clocks without the probability of any glitches under most of the scenarios, hence, also called glitch-less multiplexer.
**Definition of clock multiplexer**: Let us first define a clock multiplexer "A clock multiplexer is a circuit that can switch the system from one clock to another while the chip is running. The two frequencies may be related to each other, or may to totally unrelated". A clock multiplexer switches the clock without any glitches as the glitch in clock will be hazardous for the system. Hence, a clock multiplexer is also known as a glitchless multiplexer.
**Clock multiplexer for switching between two synchronous clocks**:

Hi
You may or may not use depending upon the exposure of the clock to external observations. But nothing would harm making these scan flops in my opinion.

### 25. Reset basics

**Date:** 2017-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/reset-basics.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/reset-basics.html)

### Reset basics
**Purpose of reset**: We see that almost every electronic device has a reset button. Your video game has a reset button that resets the game and your unsaved progress is lost. Your laptop's reset button reboots it. Have you ever wondered why a system (or specifically a chip) has a reset? Well, the simple purpose of resets is to provide a known initial state to the system to start with. Another reason is, when the system accidentally goes into some unknown state (there may be many reasons for this), the system always knows how to get out of this and go into a known state by asserting a reset signal.
**Reset design strategies**: Defining a reset is one of the most important decisions that needs to be taken for the good health of design. In general, following things need to be kept in mind during deciding reset strategy:
- **What flops to receive reset**: One of the easiest and safest approaches is to enable all the flip-flops in the design with a reset. However, there may be a some registers, whose initial state will not have any impact on the design state. In other words, it might not matter if the register's output is '0' or '1' when design goes in reset state. Such registers can be kept non-resettable after an analysis. Let us elaborate with the help of an example. Figure 1 shows a part of an FSM wherein two registers are feeding an AND gate. In figure 1(a), we have decided to initialize both to '0' during reset ( **with an asynchronous reset, to be explained later**). However, given this scenario, if one of the flip-flops is provided with an initial state of '0', the output of the other will be gated. So, we may omit reset on one of the flip-flops. Figure 1(b) shows that omission of reset on one of the flip-flops does not have any impact on state machine design.

> We may not always encounter such scenarios. If, instead of AND gate, we had an OR gate, we would not have been able to keep one of the flip-flops uninitialized during reset. Figure 2 shows such an example. In figure 2(b), if we remove reset from second flip-flop, output of OR gate goes 'X'; thus, impacting the state machine.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhIGp0D5GRVoWk3DWWFwMrIrspLFgvLIAuXI2KIWmvdPT-0glUpse-9Th7c7Wd7J-VdUvMIj5FHtVEV9JJzMf_HR323MfKFasf4W4VbEYM1qZ-SphIvB_coWUoGPWYd7-DzTEcp_nuDQiMz/s640/reset_strategy_2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhIGp0D5GRVoWk3DWWFwMrIrspLFgvLIAuXI2KIWmvdPT-0glUpse-9Th7c7Wd7J-VdUvMIj5FHtVEV9JJzMf_HR323MfKFasf4W4VbEYM1qZ-SphIvB_coWUoGPWYd7-DzTEcp_nuDQiMz/s1600/reset_strategy_2.png)
> Another popular scenario wherein we can skip a few registers from having a reset pin is shift registers. If the first stage of a shift register is you give more than one clock pulses when in reset state, subsequent stages will get reset. If you have four stages, you need to give at least three clock pulses while in reset. The same is shown in figure below.

- **Synchronous vs asynchronous reset**: There are two kinds of reset assertion/deassertion strategies - synchronous vs asynchronous reset. Although each of the two can be used to effective implementation of reset, each of these has its own advantages/disadvantages. Designer may decide upon the desired strategy by considering the pros and cons.
  - Synchronous reset means that the reset will affect the state of the design only on the active edge of the clock.
  - Asynchronous reset resets the design asynchronously. For this purpose, flip-flops have a special pin that resets the output to '0' or '1' based upon the need.

### 26. VLSI - 3

**Date:** 2017-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/vlsi-3.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/vlsi-3.html)

### VLSI - 3
So continuing on the previous post of two current sources in series, this example is important when you analyze lot of circuits.
Lets assume you simulate with ideal current sources
Case 1 : When top current source > lower current source
Since, they are ideal current sources, it happens that they will sink or source that much current ir respective of the voltage across the sources, so it implies that currents may be unequal in single wire and the node potential in between increases.
The reason it increases is that top current source pumps in current but the down source only sinks lesser current, hence forth the rest of the current will charge up the cap at the node and hence forth increases the node potential.
Case 2 : When top current source < lower current source
Since, they are ideal current sources, it happens that they will sink or source that much current ir respective of the voltage across the sources, so it implies that currents may be unequal in single wire and the node potential in between decreases.
The reason it increases is that top current source pumps in lesser current but the down source only sinks higher current, hence forth the rest of the current will be provided by the cap at the node and hence forth decreases the node potential.
Interested studentts should find time in simulating the circuit by replacing the current sources with NMOS and PMOS and understand what will happen.
This is an important step in understanding CMFB.

Neeraj,As for as i know, we should not connect two current sources in series because it is a KCL violation.Then, how come it possible to connect them in series. Please clarify.

Hi Praveen, it is good to see you thought of it. Let me clarify you. First of all, no one is going to stop you from doing it atleast with ideal sources.
1\. When you have the circuit with ideal sources of cadence schematic, then you can have two different currents flowing.
2\. If one of the current sources is replaced with NMOS/PMOS, then the current decided by the ideal current source is only going to still flow.
Let me explain in this way. When you have a current being pumped onto a node and some current being drawn out of a node, unless they are equal, there is no way that potential is going to zero. If both are ideal and if top > down, means u are pumping in more charge and drawing out less charge, which means that the KCL is getting violated. So the extra current flows into the node cap and the voltage increases.
Now I guess you can understand it better.
Any doubts, feel free to comment. Thanks for your interest. All the best

### 27. STA problem: Finding setup and hold slack taking into accoung clock skew

**Date:** 2017-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/sta-problem-finding-setup-and-hold_4.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/sta-problem-finding-setup-and-hold_4.html)

### STA problem: Finding setup and hold slack taking into accoung clock skew
**Problem**: Figure 1 below shows a timing path from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop to a positive edge-triggered flip-flop. Considering clock frequency of 200 MHz, find the setup and hold slacks for this timing path.
**Solution**:
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Omhik0_d5-Z4hwtuBgbV_vInWA7dJ8D1UzZcDF-ulCtycHcO33EnUhi2veeEr5cOxWbcPrVQQ7NaiQBeM80CIrkedWvrsjCS5L8qw9Fs2lcJ994AIoIhJVGTq84KUYpTBKM8do-oN_qJ/s640/timing_path.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Omhik0_d5-Z4hwtuBgbV_vInWA7dJ8D1UzZcDF-ulCtycHcO33EnUhi2veeEr5cOxWbcPrVQQ7NaiQBeM80CIrkedWvrsjCS5L8qw9Fs2lcJ994AIoIhJVGTq84KUYpTBKM8do-oN_qJ/s1600/timing_path.png) |
| **Figure 1: Timing path** |
As the clock frequency is given as a 200 MHz, time period = 1/frequency = 5 ns.
Let us first calculate the setup slack. The setup timing equation is given as:
> **Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup \- Tskew < Tperiod**
And equation for setup slack is given as:
> **SS =****Tperiod -** **(Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup** **\- Tskew** **)**
Here,
> **Tck->q = 2ns, Tprop (max value of delay of combinational logic) = 4 ns+ Tsetup = 1 ns,   Tperiod** **= 5 ns, Tskew = 1 ns**
Putting these values into equation for setup slack, we get setup slack for this timing path.
> SS = 5 - (2 + 4 + 1 - 1) ns
> SS = -1 ns
Now, hold slack can be found out from the hold timing equation. The hold timing equation is given as:
> > **Tck->q** **\+ Tprop** **\> Thold \+ Tskew**
Here,
> **Tck->q** **=  2 ns, Tprop** **(min value of combinational propagation delay) = 4 ns, Thold = 1ns, Tskew** **= 1 ns**
And the equation for hold slack is given as:
> **HS = Tck->q \+ Tprop  \- (Thold \+ Tskew)**
> **HS = 2 + 4 - (1 + 1) = 4 ns**
So, for this timing path, setup slack value is -1 ns and hold slack value is 4 ns.

### 28. STA problem: Finding setup and hold slack considering ideal clock

**Date:** 2017-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/sta-problem-finding-setup-and-hold.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/sta-problem-finding-setup-and-hold.html)

### STA problem: Finding setup and hold slack considering ideal clock
**Problem**: Figure 1 below shows a timing path from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop to a positive edge-triggered flip-flop. Considering ideal clocks, and clock frequency of 100 MHz, find the setup and hold slacks for this timing path.
**Solution**:
|     |

| **Figure 1: Timing path** |
Ideally, all the flip-flops in design should get clock at the same time. So, ideal clock means that launch as well as capture flip-flops get clock at zero time. In other words, we can assume that clock skew is zero between start and end points.
As the clock frequency is given as a 100 MHz, time period = 1/frequency = 10 ns.
Let us first calculate the setup slack. The setup timing equation is given as:
> **Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup \- Tskew < Tperiod**
And equation for setup slack is given as:
> SS = **Tperiod -** **(Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup** **\- Tskew** **)**
Here,
> **Tck->q = 2ns, Tprop (max value of delay of combinational logic) = 4 ns+ Tsetup = 1 ns,   Tperiod** **= 10 ns**
Putting these values into equation for setup slack, we get setup slack for this timing path.
> SS = 10 - (2 + 4 + 1 - 0) ns
> SS = 3 ns
Now, hold slack can be found out from the hold timing equation. The hold timing equation is given as:
> > **Tck->q** **\+ Tprop** **\> Thold \+ Tskew**
Here,
> **Tck->q** **=  2 ns, Tprop** **(min value of combinational propagation delay) = 4 ns, Thold = 1 ns**
And the equation for hold slack is given as:
> **HS = Tck->q \+ Tprop  \- (Thold \+ Tskew)**
> **HS = 2 + 4 - (1 + 0) = 5 ns**
So, for this timing path, setup slack value is 3 ns and hold slack value is 5 ns.

### 29. LVS in VLSI

**Date:** 2017-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/lvs-in-vlsi.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/lvs-in-vlsi.html)

### LVS in VLSI
LVS stands for Layout vs Schematic. It is one of the steps of physical verification; the other one being DRC (Design Rule Check). While DRC only checks for certain layout rules to ensure the design will be manufactured reliably, functional correctness of the design is ensured by LVS.
Layout vs Schematic (LVS) compares the design layout with the design schematic/netlist to tell if the design is functionally equivalent to schematic. For this, the connections are extracted from layout of the design by using a set of rules to convert the layout to connections. These connections are, then compared if they match with the connections of the netlist. If the connections match, the LVS is said to be clean.

### 30. VLSI - 2 ( Analog)

**Date:** 2017-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/vlsi-2-analog.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/03/vlsi-2-analog.html)

### VLSI - 2 ( Analog)
For those of you who wanted to make a career in analog, be a devotee of IIT Madras faculty irrespective of which IIT or which college you end up joining for your Mtech.
1\. Shanti Pavan - IIT Madras videos
2\. Nagendra Krishnapura - IIT Madras videos
3\. Razavi - Videos and Text book
4\. Anirudhan  - IIT Madras videos
I would like to discuss few common blunders, that we end up doing, which henceforth make us loose confidence in analog
**Mistake 1 :  Two current sources in series**
In simulation if you put two current sources in series and simulate this, you observe some crazy things happen, kindly do this and learn on this.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLkySH3t24RkOgpn6Ee-bJHebffLd_HQXQM7ECglLH73eIz4CnSw-rxxxZRh6X6PssJljYK4nIjCuups6Xoqygv7Y7_DhXmmQmrZyp7DdveC7R3OUzfEEnC0uKGnNPdNzMKGo8k86oF48/s320/Capture.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLkySH3t24RkOgpn6Ee-bJHebffLd_HQXQM7ECglLH73eIz4CnSw-rxxxZRh6X6PssJljYK4nIjCuups6Xoqygv7Y7_DhXmmQmrZyp7DdveC7R3OUzfEEnC0uKGnNPdNzMKGo8k86oF48/s1600/Capture.PNG)
Put up a current source with NMOS sinking the current with very low Vgs and observe
Repeat the experiment with PMOS too. Try increasing the sizing for the same Vgs and observe what happens.
This experiments are really the most powerful in analog. The deeper one digs into this, the faster he understands the analog concepts well.
Spend great time dealing with this circuit.
Feel free to discuss if any doubts.......

### 31. VLSI - 1

**Date:** 2017-02
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/02/vlsi-1.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/02/vlsi-1.html)

### VLSI - 1
Without doubt, VLSI is top branch of ECE which fascinates many graduates and also a hot cake, henceforth making it a very competitive branch to get into even in your Mtech.
Roughly one can divide VLSI into 3 specializations:
Analog VLSI
Digital VLSI
Device Electronics

Analog VLSI  --- is something that really fascinates many VLSI students but often, doesn't become a career option for many of those bright students. It is much more than the coding stuff. Analog needs your thinking cap to be on always. It needs understanding of device physics too to a reasonable extent.
Any chip that gets taped out has all blocks of analog, digital. Band gap ckts, Reference current sources, IO components, PLLs, Amplifiers, filters, transmitters, receivers and many blocks are all analog in nature.
Most of the digital stuff are coded and even the interface circuits that is A/D convertors, sensors, and D/A convertors are all analog blocks !!!
The real world is analog in nature and any advancements we talk about DSP, can be appreciated only if u have proper interface circuits to convert the analog signal to digital and do DSP and convert it back to analog again.

### 32. Difference between fluorescence and phosphorescence

**Date:** 2017-02
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/02/difference-between-fluorescence-and.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/02/difference-between-fluorescence-and.html)

### Difference between fluorescence and phosphorescence
When electron beam hits phosphorus coated screen, some of the energy of these electrons in dissipated as heat and rest is transferred to electrons of phosphorus which makes them jump to higher energy levels. As we know that higher energy state is unstable and when electron comes to its original state energy is emitted in the form of light(color of light depend upon level from which electrons is returning).
In Ph, some energy levels are less stable than others so electrons in this state returns more rapidly than others.
Hence energy(in the form of light) emitted when these unstable electron return from higher state to its original state _while electrons are bombarded on it_ is called **fluorescence.**
While the  energy emitted when stable electrons return from higher energy levels to its original energy level _once electron beam excitation is removed_ is called **phosphorescence.**
most of the light emitted in typical Ph is phosphorescence.
**Persistence :** It is defined as the time from removal of excitation of electron beam to the time when the phosphorescence has decayed to 10% of initial light output. Typically it is between 10-60 microsecond.

### 33. How to fix hold violations

**Date:** 2017-02
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/02/fixing-hold-violations.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/02/fixing-hold-violations.html)

### How to fix hold violations
In the post [setup and hold time violations](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2017/02/setup-and-hold-violations.html), we learnt about the setup time violations and hold time violations. In this post, we will learn the approaches to tackle hold time violations. Following strategies can be useful in reducing the magnitude of hold violation and bringing the hold slack towards a positive value:
**1\. Insert delay elements**: This is the simplest we can do, if we are to decrease the magnitude of a hold time violation. The increase in data path delay can be increased if we insert delay elements in the data-path. Thus, the hold violating path's delay can be increased, and hence, slack can be made positive by inserting buffers in hold violating data-path.
**2\. Reduce the drive strength of data-path logic gates**: Replacing a cell with a similar cell of less drive strength will certainly add delay to data-path. However, there is a slight chance of decrease in data-path delay if the cell load is dominated by intrinsic capacitance as we discussed in **[how delay of a standard cell changes with drive strength](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/12/how-delay-of-standard-cell-changes-with.html)**
**3\. Use data-path cells with higher threshold voltages**: If you have multiple flavors of threshold voltages in your design, the cells with higher threshold voltage will certainly have higher delays. So, this must be the first option you must be looking for to resolve hold violations.
**4\.** Improve hold time of capturing flip-flop: Using a capturing flip-flop with higher drive strength and/or lower threshold voltage will give a lower hold time requirement. Also, improving the transition at flip-flop's clock pin reduces its hold time requirement.
**5\. Detoured routing**: Detoured routing can be adoped as an alternative to insertion of delay elements as it will add load to the driving cell as well as provide additional net delay thereby increasing the data-path delay.
**6\. Play with clock skew**: A positive skew degrades hold timing and a negative skew aids hold timing. So, if a data-path is violating, we can either decrease the latency of capturing flip-flop or increase the clock latency of launching flip-flop. However, in doing so, we need to keep in mind the setup and hold slacks of other timing paths starting and/or ending at these flip-flops.
**7\. Increase the clk->q delay of launching flip-flop**: A launching flip-flop with more clk->q delay will help ease the hold timing of the data-path. For this, either we can decrease the drive strength of the flip-flop or move it to higher threshold voltage.

Can you confirm on the following statement.
"Also, degrading the transition at flip-flop's clock pin reduces its hold time requirement."
Do we need to degrade/improve transition at capture flop to have better hold time requirement?

Hi
There are two variables:
1\. Transition at clock pin: degrading clock transition will help have better hold time requirement
2\. Transition at data pin: Improving data transition will help have better hold time requirement

### 34. How to fix setup violations

**Date:** 2017-02
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/02/fixing-setup-violations.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/02/fixing-setup-violations.html)

### How to fix setup violations
In the post [setup and hold time violations](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2017/02/setup-and-hold-violations.html), we learnt about the setup time violations and hold time violations. In this post, we will learn the approaches to tackle setup time violations. Following strategies can be useful in reducing the magnitude of setup violation and bringing it closer towards a positive value:
**1. Increase the drive strength of data-path logic gates**: A cell with better drive strength can charge the load capacitance quickly, resulting in lesser propagation delay. Also, the output transition should improve resulting in better delay of proceeding stages.
We can view a logic gate as a certain ON-resistance, that will charge/discharge a load capacitor to toggle the output state. This will form an RC circuit with a certain RC time constant. A better drive-strength gate will have a lesser resistance, effectively lowering the RC time constant; hence, providing less delay. This is illustrated in figure 1 below. If an AND gate of drive strength 'X' has a pull down resistance equivalent to 'R', the one with drive strength '2X' will have R/2 resistance. Thus, a bigger AND gate with better drive strength will have less delay.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-iMF8ByIvK561EFZTLkQnzhGTrLwl-uWi9oqLz_9PL2qSblBnqGJE9NEQkM4H9lOYMk7gGLtnGl2Jd0a9jfmiIizlxVbgEzbwcuM5X8qtQJuxUciqdJGiDt7ZwmyjHW8NyDoIIPX-i2cz/s640/drive_strength.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-iMF8ByIvK561EFZTLkQnzhGTrLwl-uWi9oqLz_9PL2qSblBnqGJE9NEQkM4H9lOYMk7gGLtnGl2Jd0a9jfmiIizlxVbgEzbwcuM5X8qtQJuxUciqdJGiDt7ZwmyjHW8NyDoIIPX-i2cz/s1600/drive_strength.png)
This strategy is going to give best results only if the load of the cell is dominated by external load capacitance. Generally, drive strength of a cell is proportional to the cell size. Thus, increasing the cell size halves its internal resistance, but doubles the internal node capacitance. Thus, as shown in figure 2, the zero load capacitance delay of a cell ideally remains same of doubling the size of the cell.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJS-HZRLLKDtWQSxXbZd_uDefYpgpFkq_AzGz6UsO2JAS9QiZYOdP_Cj2Iv1JBOsRrdDzs3RW10vq-4MB4Lsn_PBXP7MWsim6lT2Nkwhi2R4foKA0t8p6Rdsa5jwyk_fCFx7VJDttMK8Ap/s640/drive_strength_2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJS-HZRLLKDtWQSxXbZd_uDefYpgpFkq_AzGz6UsO2JAS9QiZYOdP_Cj2Iv1JBOsRrdDzs3RW10vq-4MB4Lsn_PBXP7MWsim6lT2Nkwhi2R4foKA0t8p6Rdsa5jwyk_fCFx7VJDttMK8Ap/s1600/drive_strength_2.png)
Thus, upon doubling the drive strength of the cell, (assuming D to be the original delay) the delay can be anything between D/2 to D depending upon the ratio of intrinsic and external load capacitance.
Moreover, the input pin capacitance is a by-product of the size of the cell. Thus, increasing the size of the cell results in increased load for the driver cell of its input pins. So, in some cases (very high drive strength cell with less load driven by a low drive strength cell), increasing the drive strength can result in increase in magnitude of setup violation.
Keeping aside timing, power dissipation (both leakage as well as dynamic power) are a function of cell drive strength. Also, area is a function of cell drive strength. So, increasing the drive strength to fix a setup violation results in both area and power increase (although very small in comparison to whole design).
2\. **Use the data-path cells with lesser threshold voltages**: If you have multiple flavors of threshold voltages in your designs, the cell with lesser threshold voltage will certainly have less delay. So, this must be the first step to resolve setup violations.
3\. **Improve the setup time of capturing flip-flop**: As we know, the setup time of a flip-flop is a function of the transition at its data pin and clock pin. Better the transition at data pin, less is setup time. And worse clock transition causes less setup time. Also, a flip-flop with higher drive strength and/or lower threshold voltage is more probable of having less setup time requirement. Also, increasing the drive strength of flip-flop might cause the transition at clock pin and data pin to get worse due to higher pin loads. This also plays a role in deciding the setup time.
4\. **Restructuring of the data-path**: Based upon the placement of data path logic cells, you can decide either to combine simple logic gates into a complex gate, or split a multi-stage cell into simpler logic gates. A multi-stage gate is optimized in terms of area, power and timing. For example, a 2:1 mux will have less logic delay than 1 AND gate and 1 OR gate combined for same output load capacitance. But, if you need to traverse distance, then 2 stages of logic can help as a buffer will introduce additional delay.
Let us elaborate this with the help of an example wherein a data-path traverses a 3-input AND gate from FF1 to FF2 situated around 400 micron apart. Let us assume one logic cell can drive 200 micron and each logic cell has only one drive strength available for simplicity. The choice is between two 2-input AND gates and 1 3-input AND gate. In this case, 3-input AND gate should give less delay (may be 200 ps for two 2-input AND vs 150 ps for one 3-input AND) as it has been optimized for less area, timing and power as compared to two 2-input AND gates.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigMoEexP0f89eATv8pZmF2v2TaiAdKkKGpBrFpVe7CLlgpvjOHMN6dHJCtkCPGIzHPSK8eGyEMhgknF2KabeVtHwc6fYSSE1M99MKFT3T4tH3Ph_ANAI5RmByIusfcfUf74CeFh7AoUoM1/s640/2+input+vs+3+input+gates.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigMoEexP0f89eATv8pZmF2v2TaiAdKkKGpBrFpVe7CLlgpvjOHMN6dHJCtkCPGIzHPSK8eGyEMhgknF2KabeVtHwc6fYSSE1M99MKFT3T4tH3Ph_ANAI5RmByIusfcfUf74CeFh7AoUoM1/s1600/2+input+vs+3+input+gates.png)
Now, consider another case where the FF1 and FF2 are at a distance of 600 micron. In this case, if we use two 2-input AND gates, we can place them spaced apart 200 micron and hence, can cover the distance. But, if we use one 3-input AND gate, we will need to add a repeater, which will have its own delay. In this case, using two 2-input AND gates should give better results in terms of overall data-path delay.

**5.** **Routing topologies**: Sometimes, when there are a lot of nets at a certain place in the design, the routing tool can detour the nets trying to get the place less congested. Thus, two logic cells might be placed very close, still the delay can seem to be high for both the cells ; for driver cell due to high net capacitance and for load cell due to poor transition at the input. Also, net delay can be a significant component in such scenarios. Below figure shows one such example of two AND gates situated a certain distance apart. Ideally, there could be a straight net route between the two gates. But, due to very high net density in the region, router tool chose to route the way as shown on the right to help ease the congestion (this is an exaggerated scenario to help understand better).

So, always give proper importance to net routing topology, at least for setup timing critical nets. A few tips to improve the timing you can try include:
- Try the net to have as less detouring as possible
- Vias increase the net resistance. So, try to have as less vias as possible
- Higher metal layers have less resistance. So, long nets can be routed in higher layers to have less net delay
**6\. Add repeaters**: Every logic cell has a limit upto which it can drive a load capacitance. After that, its delay starts increasing rapidly. Since, net capacitance is a function of net length, we should keep a limit on the length of net driven by a gate. Also, net delay itself is proportional to square of net length. Moreover, the transitions may be very bad in such cases. So, it is wise to add repeater buffers after a certain distance, in order to ensure that the signal is transferred reliably, and in time.
**7\. Play with clock skew**: Positive skew helps improve the setup slack. So, to fix setup violation, we may either choose to increase the clock latency of capturing flip-flop, or decrease the clock latency of launching flip-flop. However, in doing so, we need to be careful regarding setup and hold slack of other timing paths that are being formed from/to these flip-flops.
**8\. Increase clock period**: As a last resort, you may choose to time your design at reduced frequency. But, if you are targeting a particular performance, you need a minimum frequency. In that case, this option is not for you.
**9\. Improve the clk->q delay of launching flip-flop:** A flip-flop with less clk->q delay will help meeting a violating setup timing path. This can be achieved by:
- Improving transition at flip-flops clock pin
- Choosing a flip-flop of high drive strength. However, if by doing so, clock transition degrades, delay can actually increase
- Replacing the flip-flop with a flip-flop of same drive strength, but lower Vt
In this post, we learnt how to approach a setup violating timing path. Have you ever used a method that is not listed above? Please share your experience in comments. We will be happy to hear from you.

Excellent work bro, Have some below listed queries
1\. In step 1 (Increase the drive strength of data-path logic gates) you had mentioned that cell size can be increased to increase drive strength. what does the cell size here refers to ? will it mean increase in process technology like moving from one nano meter to other (0.10nm to 0.28 nm).
If that is the case, is it possible to increase specific cells ( path having higher delay) alone to different technology ? Because mostly i heared like the entire chip will be made up by single technology like (0.28nm chip).
Correct my understanding if i'm wrong.
2\. In step 6 ( Adding repeaters), But repeaters will in turn take some delay right? Do you mean that delay caused by repeater is very less when compared to net delay.

Hi
1\. You are right that entire chip needs to be made into a single technology. I would digress slightly away from topic, but technology refers to the minimum dimensions that can be drawn. For instance, 28 nm technology has requirement for wire width to be, say, minimum of 35 nm. But we can always draw wires with larger width like 100 nm, which can be the minimum wire width of 90 nm technology. And 100 nm width wires will have less resistance than 35 nm wires. So, technology is just a placeholder for minimum dimensions.
Coming back to query, increasing cell size means increasing "W" while keeping "L" constant for all the transistors in the cell. It also means using a cell with higher drive strength.
2\. Yes, repeaters will take some delay. But a repeater can only handle load until a specific limit. I recommend you to first go through this post "https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/12/how-delay-of-standard-cell-changes-with.html". I guess the answer should be implicit after that. In case there are any queries, we can always discuss.

1\. Thank u, which means we can able to increase wire width of specific cell's alone (worst case timing path cells). Is that possible ? Apart from that, increase in wire width by keeping L as constant will leads to increase in overall area of transistor right?

Hi
At cell level (assuming we are talking about SoC design flow), increasing wire width will not be possible because cells are picked from specific cell libraries. So, changing attributes of a cell is not possible. :-) But yes, you can change the width of net connected to cell. But there are pros and cons of doing this. Because increasing the width decreases R, but at the same time, increases C. So, if the net is very small, we may not see any improvement in delay (or we may see delay degradation) as well.

Hi
Will increasing the width of the net increase and decrease the capacitance and resistance respectively by the same amount? If this is so, it means that the time constant of the net will remain unchanged even after the new size.
Unless, the resistance and capacitance get modified differently upon resizing of the net's width?

Hi, on a first level, yes. there may be slight modification based upon higher order effects. Yes, time constant of the net will remain same if we consider lumped parasitics. But on decreasing net capacitance, the driver cell supplies better transition signal. So, in most of the cases, delay of the net should improve.

hi.
i have some question..
you say that 9. Choosing a flip-flop of high drive strength. However, if by doing so, clock transition degrades, delay can actually increase
but i learned that if drive strength increase, delay and transition is better(short,,?).
it is different flipflop drive strength and other drive strength?

Number "9. Improve (Reduce) the d->q delay..." can also be accomplished by reducing the fanout. Fanout can be reduced through register duplication.

### 35. Setup and hold violations

**Date:** 2017-02
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/02/setup-and-hold-violations.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/02/setup-and-hold-violations.html)

### Setup and hold violations
**What is meant by setup and/or hold violations**: The ultimate aim of timing analysis is to get the design work at required frequency and with reliability. For this to happen, it must be ensured in timing that all the state transitions are happening smoothly; i.e., the setup and hold requirements of all the timing paths in the design are met. If there are failing setup and/or hold paths, the design is said to have violations.
**What if setup and/or hold violations occur in a design**: As said earlier, setup and hold timings are to be met in order to ensure that data launched from one flop is captured properly at another and in accordance to the state machine designed. In other words, no timing violations means that the data launched by one flip-flop at one clock edge is getting captured by another flip-flop at the desired clock edge. If the setup check is violated, data will not be captured properly at the next clock edge. Similarly, if hold check is violated, data intended to get captured at the next edge will get captured at the same edge. Moreover, setup/hold violations can lead to data getting captured within the setup/hold window which can lead to metastability of the capturing flip-flop (as explained in our post [metastability](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2013/02/metastability.html)). So, it is very important to have setup and hold requirements met for all the registers in the design and there should not be any setup/hold violations.
**Setup violations**: As we know, setup checks are applied for timing paths to get the state machine to move to the next state. The timing equation for a setup check from positive edge-triggered flip-flop to positive edge-triggered flip-flop is given as below:
> **Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup \- Tskew < Tperiod**
For a timing path to meet setup requirements, this equation needs to be satisfied. The difference between left and right sides is represented by a parameter known as **setup slack.**
**Setup slack** is the margin by which a timing path meets setup check requirement. It is given as the difference in R.H.S. and L.H.S. of setup timing equation. The equation for setup slack is given as:
> **Setup slack =****Tperiod** **\-  Tck->q \- Tprop \- Tsetup+ Tskew**
If setup slack is positive, it means the timing path meets setup requirement. On the other hand, a negative setup slack means setup violating timing path. If, by chance, a fabricated design is found to have a setup violation, you can still run the design at less frequency than specified and get the desired functionality as setup equation includes clock period as a variable.
If we analyze setup equation more closely, it involves four parameters:
1. **Data path delay**: More the total delay of data path (flip-flop delay + combinational delay + Setup), less is setup slack
2. **Clock skew**: More the clock skew (difference between arrival times of clock at capture and launch flip-flops), more is the setup slack
3. **Setup time requirement of capturing flip-flp**: Less the setup time requirement, more will be setup slack
4. **Clock period**: More is the clock period, more is the setup slack. However, if you are targetting a specific clock period, doing this is not an option. :-)
**How to tackle setup violations**: The ultimate goal of timing analysis is to get every timing path follow setup equation and get a positive setup slack number for every timing path in the design. If a timing path is violating setup timing (assuming we are targetting a certain clock frequency), we can try one or more of the following to bring the setup slack back to a positive value by:
- Decreasing data path delay
- Choosing a flip-flop with less setup time requirement
- Increasing clock skew
[How to fix setup violations](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/02/fixing-setup-violations.html) discusses various ways to tackle setup violations.
**Hold violations:** As we know, hold checks are applied to ensure that the state machine remains in its present state until desired. The hold timing equation for a timing path from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop to another positive edge-triggered flip-flop is governed by the following equation:
> **Tck->q** **\+ Tprop** **\> Thold \+ Tskew**
Similar to setup slack, the presence and magnitude of hold violation is governed by a parameter called as hold slack. The hold slack is defined as the amount by which L.H.S is greater than R.H.S. In other words, it is the margin by which timing path meets the hold timing check. The equation for hold slack is given as:
> **Hold slack = Tck->q** **\+ Tprop -** **Thold \+ Tskew**
If hold slack is positive, it means there is still some margin available before it will start violating for hold. A negative hold slack means the path is violating hold timing check by the amount represented by hold slack. To get the path met, either data path delay should be increased, or clock skew/hold requirement of capturing flop should be decreased.
If we analyze hold timing equation more closely, it involves three parameters:
1. **Data path delay**: More data path delay favours hold slack; hence, more data path delay, more is the margin
2. **Skew**: Having a positive skew degrades hold slack
3. **Hold requirement of capturing flip-flop**: Less the hold requirement, more will be hold slack
**How to tackle hold violations:** Similar to setup analysis, the ultimate aim of hold analysis is to get every timing path follow the hold timing equation and get a positive hold slack for each and every timing path in the design. If a timing path violates for hold, we can do either of the following:
- Increase data path delay
- Decrease clock skew
- Choose a flip-flop with less hold requirement

hello sir
have a doubt regards your hold slack equation
Hold slack = Tck->q + Tprop - Thold + Tskew
tskew should be negative ?

Hai sir,
Why we would take clk path as min path and data path as max path in setup time calculation...

Because we have to cover worst case scenario which occurs when data arrives late and clock arrives early.

### 37. Clock skew

**Date:** 2017-01
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/01/clock-skew.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/01/clock-skew.html)

### Clock skew
Clock skew is one of the most important parameters of a good physical design implementation. Keeping the clock skew to a minimum is considered to be a good measure of clock tree synthesis.
**Definition of clock skew**: Clock skew between two flip-flops represents the difference in arrival times of clock signal at the respective clock pins. If there is a timing path being formed between the two flip-flops, then we can attribute a sign to the clock skew. In that case, clock skew is given as:
> **_Clock skew = (Arrival time at capture clock pin) - (Arrival time at launch clock pin)_**
Thus, based upon the sign of clock skew, we get two types of clock skew labelled as positive skew and negative skew.
**Positive clock skew**: If the clock arrival time at capture flip-flop is greater than that at launch flip-flop, clock skew is said to be positive. Assuming all buffers take the same delay, figure 1 shows a scenario of positive clock skew.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQwsBz1HZ8uPmwIv2CggveGN_LVVBJKNrOLXxAqCz4VjCc1trBJb9dRO7aqTb61kGgK41voLBohfZgHT_V7tDVW64LklyLTIrv2hiecgeVE_zSQw-qc1HSs1GJF-TJrK9xKNAnHj2fMUdO/s640/positive+clock+skew.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQwsBz1HZ8uPmwIv2CggveGN_LVVBJKNrOLXxAqCz4VjCc1trBJb9dRO7aqTb61kGgK41voLBohfZgHT_V7tDVW64LklyLTIrv2hiecgeVE_zSQw-qc1HSs1GJF-TJrK9xKNAnHj2fMUdO/s1600/positive+clock+skew.png)
As shown in figure 1 above for the case of positive clock skew, flip-flop capturing data is getting delayed clock signal. So, the data that is launched gets additional time before it is captured at the next edge. So, setup check gets relaxed by the amount equivalent to clock skew. On the other hand, for hold check, the data has to be kept stable for an extra amount of time equal to the clock skew. So, hold check gets tightened in case clock skew is positive. The same is shown in figure 2 below.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdoI1oqDsg7gJdnaJx6QnyZP76k0TcyYdVc7JOxgBMqX8ij6vxffSo3_NL4D3ha-g9PqCxaIlKe7mLaU9hSMC5piAkpUepstkk0IPJL6vRbrdKSd4_47ODsZu8RRi1tw6IxB5m-pHCM9Lc/s640/positive+clock+skew+waveform.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdoI1oqDsg7gJdnaJx6QnyZP76k0TcyYdVc7JOxgBMqX8ij6vxffSo3_NL4D3ha-g9PqCxaIlKe7mLaU9hSMC5piAkpUepstkk0IPJL6vRbrdKSd4_47ODsZu8RRi1tw6IxB5m-pHCM9Lc/s1600/positive+clock+skew+waveform.png)
**Negative clock skew**: Contrary to positive clock skew, if the clock arrival time at capture flip-flop is less than the launch flip-flop, clock skew is said to be negative. Figure 3 shows a scenario of negative clock skew as the launch flip-flop getting a delayed version of clock signal.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiEiv-MrFfLB7P_IrBnOijYpeh367D07fWeL94VsFX6yEHUVtVrD-KDM33jP1vcO4IExcl_bxF_8TDArBUSPqrgT9kOjVNTcAcp7OAxWbtjEO1Y4r2su2fvbJe85MI7o1iDDdKnSUSZuUHM/s640/negative+clock+skew.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiEiv-MrFfLB7P_IrBnOijYpeh367D07fWeL94VsFX6yEHUVtVrD-KDM33jP1vcO4IExcl_bxF_8TDArBUSPqrgT9kOjVNTcAcp7OAxWbtjEO1Y4r2su2fvbJe85MI7o1iDDdKnSUSZuUHM/s1600/negative+clock+skew.png)
Since, the launching flip-flop is getting a delayed version of clock, the data launched gets less than one clock period to travel to the capturing flip-flop. So, negative clock skew makes setup check tighter by the magnitude of clock skew. On the other hand, for hold check, data has to be stable for less time after the arrival of clock edge. In other words, hold check gets relaxed by the same amount. Figure 4 below shows the scenario of negative clock skew.

### 38. What makes timing paths both setup critical and hold critical

**Date:** 2017-01
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/01/setup-hold-critical-timing-paths.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/01/setup-hold-critical-timing-paths.html)

### What makes timing paths both setup critical and hold critical
Those timing paths, which are very hard to meet in timing are called timing critical paths. They can be divided into setup and hold timing critical paths.
**Setup timing critical paths**: Those paths for which meeting setup timing is difficult, can be termed as setup critical timing paths. For these paths, the setup slack value is very close to zero and for the most part of design cycle, remains below zero.
**Hold timing critical paths**: As is quite obvious, those paths for which meeting hold timing is difficult, are hold critical paths. These paths may require many buffers to meet hold slack equation.
Sometimes, we may encounter some timing paths which are violating in both setup and hold. There is not enough setup slack to make them hold timing clean and vice-versa. The good practice in timing analysis is to identify all such paths as early as possible in design cycle. Let us discuss the scenarios that make timing paths both setup and hold timing critical.
**Inherent frequency limit and delay variations**: Let us say, we want our chip to remain functional within following PVTs:
> Process : Best-case to Worst-case
> Voltage : 1.2 V with 10% voltage variation allowed (1.08 V to 1.32 V)
> Temperature : -20 degrees to +150 degress
The delay of a standard cell changes with PVTs and OCVs. Let us only talk about PVT variations. Let us say, cell delay changes by 2 times from worst case scenario (worst process, lowest voltage, worst temperature) to best case scenario (best process, highest voltage, best temperature). Let us say, setup and hold checks also scale by same amount. Remember that the equations for setup and hold need to be satisfied across all the PVTs.  Which essentially means setup needs to be ensured for WCS scenario and hold timing needs to be ensured for BCS scenario. This will provide a limit to maximum frequency that the path can be timed at. If we try to go beyond that frequency, we will not be able to ensure both setup and hold slacks remain positive.
Let us illustrate with the help of an example of a timing path from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop to positive edge-triggered flip-flop with a frequency target of 1.4 GHz (clock time period = 714 ps). Let us say, we have the Best-case and Worst-case scenarios as shown in figure 1 and 2.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZd5YLWM3t1C0K9MrUfie7muxKWSHVxQj5FjksbVnnsBcoRw0_dTp1FgsyEVAvjEHUmwV8-Gc75AvC-5sINrl4W_zrrleYjl9jjq6aDkvxT9FgSCur0PErtjUfk6BgYJojeLruSzWDKtVn/s640/bcs.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZd5YLWM3t1C0K9MrUfie7muxKWSHVxQj5FjksbVnnsBcoRw0_dTp1FgsyEVAvjEHUmwV8-Gc75AvC-5sINrl4W_zrrleYjl9jjq6aDkvxT9FgSCur0PErtjUfk6BgYJojeLruSzWDKtVn/s1600/bcs.png)
Figure 1 shows that the best-case clk->q delay for launch flop is 100 ps, best-case combinational delay is 80 ps and best-case hold time is 200 ps. Applying our hold timing equation for this case,
> Hold slack = **Tck->q** **\+ Tprop -** **Thold**
> Hold slack = 100 + 80 - 200
> Hold slack = -20 ps
So, in this case, our hold slack comes out to be negative. So, we need to apply the techniques to improve our hold slack. But we need to ensure that our setup slack is sufficiently positive. Let us look at the worst-case scenario to know about our setup slack. If we assume that everything scales by 2 times, the worst-case numbers for clk->q delay, combinational delay and setup/hold time come out to be 200 ps, 160 ps and 400 ps respectively.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLjkM1iWd_CLMxG0i_AC3AJ94akbvD4WzwdB2sn72Q6eIB3IT1TQJBtPedxtWK6oPST18oqztq6Spr2-MUHMCi1fc36M151XHVlyTn-m_ku4HtximbF_srvLCWCo4E5VoN2YNRSmXnCdKj/s640/Picture7.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLjkM1iWd_CLMxG0i_AC3AJ94akbvD4WzwdB2sn72Q6eIB3IT1TQJBtPedxtWK6oPST18oqztq6Spr2-MUHMCi1fc36M151XHVlyTn-m_ku4HtximbF_srvLCWCo4E5VoN2YNRSmXnCdKj/s1600/Picture7.png)
Applying setup timing equation for this scenario,
> Setup slack = **Tperiod** **\- (Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup)**
> Setup slack = 714 - 200 - 160 - 400 = -36 ps
Thus, for the same timing path, both setup and hold slacks are coming out to be negative. For this path, we cannot meet both setup and hold provided all these conditions. One of the solutions could be to use cells with less delay variability. Or we can limit the operating conditions to a tighter range, for instance, 1.15 to 1.25 V instead. This will improve both setup and hold slack values. If this is not an option, the only option left to satisfy timing is to add delay elements to bring hold slack to zero and reduce the frequency as the inherent variations of cells will not allow the path to operate beyond a certain frequency. Let us check at what maximum frequency our timing path will work.
First, we need to ensure hold timing is met. Thus,
> Hold slack >= 0
This translates to Combinational delay (Cb) > 100 ps, or Cb = 100 ps for a hold slack of 0 ps. In other words, worst case combinational delay is 200 ps (2 times scaling).
For a setup slack of 0 ps, operating clock frequency will be maximum; i.e.,
> **Tperiod(min) =** **Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup**
> **Tperiod(min) =** **200+ 200 \+ 400 = 800 ps**
The minimum time period that it can operate at is 800 ps, or a maximum frequency of 1.25 GHz.
In this post, we have discussed how PVT variations in delay can cause a timing path to be both setup and hold critical. Also, we discussed how it limits the frequency of operation. Although the discussion was limited to only PVT variations, OCV variations will add to the variations. The inherent equations will certainly remain same though. Also, we did not take an important parameter into consideration; i.e. clock skew. Can you think of how clock skew between the two flip-flops contribute to maximum achievable clock frequency? Or is it unrelated to clock skew?

Hi ,
Thank you for the post. Could you help me understand why certain cells will have high delay variability across corners ? or what kind of cells will have high delay variability across corners ?

High Vt cells (Vgs-Vt is small) or small strength (W is small) cells show higher variation.

Hey, great article, thank you. But, I have a question. For the first example, best-case scenario hold time violation, after CLK arrives, first flip-flop needs to hold the value at input for at least t\_hold\_time before sending it to output of FF. Therefore, should not that be included in that analysis too for hold time violation? Also, then does not that mean hold time slack between two FFs will always be positive, as after CLK comes, we have to wait for hold time of sender FF which would remove the hold time of second FF, assuming they are same type FF.

Hi Rufat
Flip-flop cannot hold data on its own. After the arrival of clock edge, the data is available at the output of flip-flop after some time. If the minimum of this time is less than the hold time of next stage flip-flop (assuming zero combinational delay for simplicity), then hold slack will be negative.

Analysis required in case of Setup / hold conflict :
1\. Are both startpoint and endpoint same ? if yes is the timing path same ?
2\. Is there any crosstalk present on path.
3\. Any high vt cell ?
This should help to resolve setup hold conflicts

### 39. Fake currency!!

**Date:** 2017-01
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/01/fake-currency.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/01/fake-currency.html)

### Fake currency!!
Problem: A woman goes to buy a pair of shoes. She stops at a shoe store and buys a pair of shoe worth 200 rupees. She hands a thousand rupee note to the shopkeeper. Shopkeeper is short of change, he goes to a nearby tea stall and brings the change. He keeps 200 rupees with himself, handing 800 rupees to the woman. After woman leaves, tea stall owner comes to the shoe store and claims the note to be a fake one. Shoe store owner checks it and agrees. Now the question is, who is in loss and by what amount?
**Will post the solution to this puzzle after some time. Till then, let us know your thoughts.**

The total loss is incurred by the shoe store owner, amounting to 1000 rupees. Here's a breakdown:
The woman paid 1000 rupees for the shoes.
The shoe store owner kept 200 rupees for the shoes and returned 800 rupees to the woman.
Later, the tea stall owner discovered the 1000 rupee note was fake and returned to the shoe store.
The shoe store owner had already given 800 rupees back to the woman, and he gave away a pair of shoes worth 200 rupees, totaling 1000 rupees in losses.
Therefore, the shoe store owner bears the loss of 1000 rupees.

A simple way to approach this issue is to remove the thousand rupee note (since its fake) and consider it as Zero rupees.
Now Lets take the perspective of all the parties involved.
Woman: Gave 0 rupees, but gained Rs.200 worth of shoes + Rs.800 in Cash. Net Rs.1000 worth of Profit.
Tea Stall Owner: Gave Rs.1000 worth of notes and gained back Rs.1000. Net Zero.
Shoe Store Owner: Started out with 0, and ended up paying Rs.1000 (800cash + 200Shoes) of loss. Net Rs.1000 loss.

### 40. Setup and hold checks

**Date:** 2017-01
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/01/setup-and-hold-checks.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/01/setup-and-hold-checks.html)

### Setup and hold checks
Setup and hold checks ensure that the finite state machine works in the way as designed. In essence, whole of the timing analysis, be it static or dynamic, revolves around setup and hold checks only. In this post, we will be touching upon setup and hold checks.
**What is meant by setup check**: Setup check ensures that the design transitions to the next state as desired through the state machine design. Mostly, the setup check is at next active clock edge relative to the edge at which data is launched. Let us call this as **default setup check**. This is, of course, in correspondence to state machine requirement to transfer to next state and the possibility of meeting both setup and hold checks together in view of delay variations accross timing corners. Figure 1 below shows the setup check for a timing path from positive edge-triggered register to negative edge-triggered register. It shows that the data launched by flop1 on positive edge will be captured by flop2 on the forthcoming negative edge and will update the state of flop2. To do so, it has to be stable at the input of flop2 before the negative edge at least setup time before.

| **Figure 1: Default setup check for a timing path from positive edge-triggered to negative edge-triggered flop** |
**What is meant by hold check**: Hold check ensures that the design does not move to the next state before its stipulated time; i.e., the design retains its present state only. The hold check should be one active edge prior to the one at which setup is checked unless there are some architectural care-abouts in the state machine design. The hold check corresponding to default setup check in such a scenario is termed as **default hold check**. Of course, there are some architectural care-abouts for this to happen. Figure 2 below shows the default hold check corresponding to the default setup check of figure 1. It shows that the data launched on positive edge by flop 1 should be captured by next negative edge and not the previous negative edge.

| **Figure 2: Default hold check for a timing path from positive edge-triggered** |
**Default setup and hold check categories**: As discussed above, for each kind of timing path, there is a default setup check and a default hold check that will be inferred unless there is an intended non-default check. We can split the setup and hold checks into following categories for our convenience. Each of the following is a link, which you can visit to know about the default setup and hold checks for each category:

- [Setup and hold checks for data-to-data checks](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/data-to-data-checks-constraining.html)
**Non-default setup and hold checks**: These are formed when the state machine behavior is different than the default intended one. Sometimes, a state machine can be designed causing the setup and hold checks to be non-default. For this to happen, of course, you have to first analyze delay variations across timing corners and ensure that the setup timing equation and hold timing equation are satisfied for all timing corner scenarios. The non-default setup and hold checks can be modeled with the help of multi-cycle path timing constraints. You may wish to go through our posts [Multicycle paths - the architectural perspective](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2014/07/multicycle-paths-sta.html) and [Multicycle paths handling in STA](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2016/07/multicycle-path-sta.html) to understand some of the concepts related to non-default setup and hold checks.

### 41. Positive, negative and zero setup time

**Date:** 2017-01
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/01/negative-setup-time.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/01/negative-setup-time.html)

### Positive, negative and zero setup time
As we know from the definition of [setup time](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/setup-time.html), setup time is a point on time axis which restrains data from changing after it. Data can change only before occurrence of setup timing point. Theoretically, there is no constraint on occurrence of setup time point with respect to clock active edge. It can either be before, after or at the same time as that of clock edge. Depending upon the relative occurrence of setup time point and clock active edge, setup time is said to be positive, zero or negative.
**Positive setup time**: When setup time point is  before the arrival of clock edge, setup time is said to be positive. Figure 1 below shows positive setup time.
|     |

| **Figure 1: Positive setup time** |
**Zero setup time**: When setup time point is at the same instant as clock's active edge, setup time is said to be zero. Figure 2 shows a situation wherein setup time is zero.

| **Figure 2: Zero setup time** |
**Negative setup time**: When setup time point occurs after clock edge, setup time is said to be negative. Figure 3 shows timing waveform for negative setup time.

| **Figure 3: Negative setup time** |
**What causes different values of setup time**: We have discussed above theoretical aspects of positive, zero and negative setup time. Let us go a bit deeper into the details. Figure 4 shows a positive level-sensitive D-latch. As we know from the definition of setup time, setup time depends upon the relative arrival times of data and clock at input transmission gate (We have to ensure data has reached upto NodeD when clock reaches input transmission gate). Depending upon the relative arrival times of data and clock, setup time can be positive, zero or negative.
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaQAoqOy831bpgMV907uJUPq11vMN9nlbn-i9hm48X-W5oe9Vzflx0jQ_TEjVzuJwGxxsPNbzshrEY1W4RKtulgciWWSwJOXqTH59zVDxtYd1Khyphenhyphenv9NCKjND1Iw4thi_TO2HtspQYv3EMq/s320/latch+setup+time.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaQAoqOy831bpgMV907uJUPq11vMN9nlbn-i9hm48X-W5oe9Vzflx0jQ_TEjVzuJwGxxsPNbzshrEY1W4RKtulgciWWSwJOXqTH59zVDxtYd1Khyphenhyphenv9NCKjND1Iw4thi_TO2HtspQYv3EMq/s1600/latch+setup+time.png) |
| **Figure 4: Positive level-sensitive latch** |
Let us assume the delay of an inverter is 1 ns. Then, to ensure that the data has reached NodeD when clock edge arrives at input transmission gate, data has to be available at the input transmission gate at least 2 ns before. So, if both data and clock reach the reference point at the same time, the latch has a setup time of 2 ns.
Now, if data takes 1 ns more than clock to reach input transmission gate from the reference point, then, data has to reach reference point at least 3 ns before clock reference point. In this case, setup time will be 3 ns.
Similarly, if data takes 1 ns less than clock to reach input transmission gate, setup time will be 1 ns. And if data takes 2 ns less than clock to reach input transmission gate, setup time will be zero.
Now, if there is further difference between delays of data and clock from respective reference points to input transmission gate, the hold time will become negative. For example, if data takes 3 ns less than clock to reach input transmission gate, setup time will be -1 ns.
This is how setup time depends upon relative delays of data and clock within the sequential element. And it completely makes sense to have negative setup time.

So it is kind of like propagation delay meeting or not meeting before the positive level of Latch 1, right?

Yes, kind of. Better be called delay difference.

One more point i would like to add. The input reference point that you are talking about the d pin and the clock pin of the flip flop. Now if the delay through the data path to latch point is shorter than the clock path to latch point , the data can arrive late at the D pin(common reference point) wrt clock at clock pin and still get captured effectively by the flip flop.So when we see wrt to the reference point it would correspond to a negative or zero setup time

Is there any violation of setup in three cases. If not any violation why?

Hi there could be or there could not be a violation.
Basically, violation depends upon expected and actual relationship between clock and data signals.
In this post, we have talked only about the actual relationship. Whether there is a violation or not will depend upon expected relationship as well.
Hope this clarifies.

### 42. Positive, negative and zero hold time

**Date:** 2017-01
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/01/negative-hold-time.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/01/negative-hold-time.html)

### Positive, negative and zero hold time
As we know from the definition of [hold time](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/hold-time.html), hold time is a point on time axis which restrains data from changing before it. Data can change only after hold time has elapsed. Now, there is no constraint on the occurrence of hold time point with respect to clock edge. It can either be after, before or at the same instant of time as that of clock active edge.
**Posotive hold time**: When hold time point is after the arrival of clock active edge, hold time is said to be positive hold time. Figure 1 below shows positive hold time.
|     |
| [![Positive hold time, hold time, data can toggle after clock edge, data needs to be stable at least for hold time after clock edge](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIQkGauYsVDEji4BMayKqThI6LQoP6Cj9CumFezKs_zVaN6qzG7Aw3EqwF_T54dSVVA3Ko-LFoYvcPVgSabRsS_byE5OdWNhUuMWAtSapAgugbYUoH-zySxszxAfjOpz8wbAKctiheSfm2/s400/positive+hold+time.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIQkGauYsVDEji4BMayKqThI6LQoP6Cj9CumFezKs_zVaN6qzG7Aw3EqwF_T54dSVVA3Ko-LFoYvcPVgSabRsS_byE5OdWNhUuMWAtSapAgugbYUoH-zySxszxAfjOpz8wbAKctiheSfm2/s1600/positive+hold+time.png) |
| **Figure 1: Positive hold time** |
**Zero hold time**: When hold time point is at the same time instant as that of clock active edge, we say that hold time of the sequential element is zero. Figure 2 below shows timing waveform for zero hold time.
|     |
| [![Data can toggle right after clock edge](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjId1XCBfa9A49z6UjatY_Xy_uSwRlfNZr3mbEK85U0F7ex4eGXXcHc4nJSaZ78fMawltgjMJRwns1AS2mEjKhqV5tpLL9fDAavfMYpkljnHQf-vd-_22bR2FhuhDTjHsPnG41CukjB-QIN/s400/Zero+hold+time.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjId1XCBfa9A49z6UjatY_Xy_uSwRlfNZr3mbEK85U0F7ex4eGXXcHc4nJSaZ78fMawltgjMJRwns1AS2mEjKhqV5tpLL9fDAavfMYpkljnHQf-vd-_22bR2FhuhDTjHsPnG41CukjB-QIN/s1600/Zero+hold+time.png) |
| **Figure 2: Zero hold time** |
**Negative hold time**: Similarly, when hold time point comes earlier on time scale as compared to data, we say that hold time of the sequential element is negative. Figure 3 shows timing waveform for negative hold time.

| [![Negative hold time allows data to toggle even before clock ege](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFjU2ICmtTcvo3Y12CucH2uYltI7uGJA-sOWY9vjKr3M5O50GZRlrdWXw16A_h2DIrGU0obDZkojveC2VRMdHfg95Tiz5h_FDyvgeuFTH4kqO080IH_NXc8OI_KxWB03m4jBn3PPZYZX4L/s400/negative+hold+time.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFjU2ICmtTcvo3Y12CucH2uYltI7uGJA-sOWY9vjKr3M5O50GZRlrdWXw16A_h2DIrGU0obDZkojveC2VRMdHfg95Tiz5h_FDyvgeuFTH4kqO080IH_NXc8OI_KxWB03m4jBn3PPZYZX4L/s1600/negative+hold+time.png) |
| **Figure 3: Negative hold time** |
We have discussed above theoretical aspects of positive, zero and negative hold time. Let us go a bit deeper into the details. Figure 4 shows a positive level-sensitive D-latch. As we know (from definition of hold time), hold time depends upon the relative arrival times of clock and data at the input transmission gate (We have to ensure data does not reach NodeC). Depending upon the times of arrival of clock and data, hold time can be positive or negative.
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaQAoqOy831bpgMV907uJUPq11vMN9nlbn-i9hm48X-W5oe9Vzflx0jQ_TEjVzuJwGxxsPNbzshrEY1W4RKtulgciWWSwJOXqTH59zVDxtYd1Khyphenhyphenv9NCKjND1Iw4thi_TO2HtspQYv3EMq/s320/latch+setup+time.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaQAoqOy831bpgMV907uJUPq11vMN9nlbn-i9hm48X-W5oe9Vzflx0jQ_TEjVzuJwGxxsPNbzshrEY1W4RKtulgciWWSwJOXqTH59zVDxtYd1Khyphenhyphenv9NCKjND1Iw4thi_TO2HtspQYv3EMq/s1600/latch+setup+time.png) |
| **Figure 4: Positive level-sensitive D-latch** |
Let us say, the delay of an inverter is 1 ns. Then, we can afford the data to reach transmission gate input even 0.9 ns before arrival of clock at transmission gate. This will ensure data reaches NodeC (-0.9 + 1 =) 0.1 n after arrival of clock edge, if allowed. But, since, clock closes transmission gate, data will not reach NodeC. So, in this case, hold time is -1 ns. If the delay from NodeB to NodeC was something else, hold time would also have been different.
Now, if we say that clock arrives at transmission gate 1 ns earlier than data, then, by above logic, hold time of this latch will be -2 ns.
Similarly, if clock arrives at transmission gate 0.5 ns after data, hold time will be -0.5 ns.
And if clock arrive at transmission gate 1 ns after data, hold time will be  zero.
If the arrival time of clock is made more late, hold time will be greater than zero. For example, if arrival time of clock is 2 ns after data, hold time will be +1 ns.
Hold time of the circuit is also dependent upon the reference point. For example, consider a multi-level black box as shown in figure 5. If we look at black box 0, its hold time is -1 ns. At level of black box 1, wherein clock travels 2 ns and data travels 0.5 ns to reach black box 0, hold time is (-1 + 2 - 0.5 = ) 0.5 ns. Similarly, at the level of black box 2, hold time is 1 ns. This is how, hold time depends upon the relative arrival times of clock and data. And it completely makes sense to have a negative hold time.

### DFT basics
DFT stands for Design For Testification. DFT engineers try to make the testing of design more cost effective by introducing some structures into the design itself. By doing so, the overall test cost, and hence, cost of production comes down. Below, we list some of our posts covering the basics of DFT. Please provide your feedbacks regarding the topics you want to see as a part of this list. :-) Happy learning.

### 1. Setup time vs hold time

**Date:** 2016-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/setup-time-vs-hold-time.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/setup-time-vs-hold-time.html)

### Setup time vs hold time
In digital designs, each and every sequential element has some restrictions related to the data with respect to clock in the form of windows in which data can change or not. There is always a region around the active edge of the clock in which data is not allowed to change at the input of the sequential element. This is because, if the data changes at the input within this window, we cannot guarantee the output. If this happens, there can be one of the three possibilities:
- Current output data can be the result of current input data
- Current output data can be the result of previous input data
- The output can go metastable (as explained in metastability)
This region around clock edge is marked by two boundary lines, one perrtaining to setup time, and other to hold time. The region between these two lines is generally termed as **setup-hold window**. Figure 1 below shows the setup-hold window.
|     |

| **Figure 1: Figure showing setup/hold window of a sequential element** |
There are certain points of difference between setup time and hold time that we need to keep in mind:
- Setup time signifies the point in time before which data needs to be stable, whereas hold time is the point of time after which the data needs to be stable
- Adherence to setup time ensures that the data launched at previous active clock edge by another flip-flop gets captured at the current clock edge. On the other hand, adherence to hold time ensures that the data launched at the current edge does not get captured on the same edge.
- Above point also means that setup time adherence ensures that the design goes to next state smoothly, whereas hold time adherence means the current state is not disturbed.
Hope this post helped you in understanding the basic difference in setup time and hold time.

### 2. Propagation delay of a net

**Date:** 2016-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/net-propagation-delay.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/net-propagation-delay.html)

### Propagation delay of a net
**Definition of net propagation delay**: The propagation delay of a net can be defined as the amount of time it takes a logic signal to propagate from the output of one logic gate to the input of another. Normally, it is defined as the difference between the times when the output of driver gate of net reaches 50% of its final value to when the input of the load cell of net reaches 50% of its final value.
**How net delay is calculated**: The net delay is calculated from the parasitics of the net. The parasitics are calculated based upon the topology of the net. These may also be read in from the parasitics file (SPEF, DSPF etc). The resulting RC-circuit resulting from the net topology is, then, simulated using certain algorithms (cosidering speed and accuracy requirements) for net delay.

### 3. Hold time

**Date:** 2016-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/hold-time.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/hold-time.html)

### Hold time
**Definition of hold time**: Hold time is defined as the minimum amount of time after arrival of clock's active edge so that it can be latched properly. In other words, each flip-flop (or any sequential element, in general) needs data to be stable for some time after arrival of clock edge such that it can reliably capture the data. This amount of time is known as **_hold time._**
We can also link hold time with state transitions. We know that the data to be captured at the current clock edge was launched at previous clock edge by some other flip-flop. And the data launched at the current clock edge must be captured at the next edge. Adherence to hold time ensures that the data launched at current edge is not captured at the current clock edge. And the data launched at previous edge is captured and not disturbed by the one launched at current edge. In other words, hold time ensures that the current state of the design is not disturbed.

| **Figure 1 : Hold time** |
Figure 1 shows that data is allowed to toggle after the yellow dotted line. This yellow dotted line corresponds to hold time. The time difference between the active clock edge and this yellow dotted line is hold time. Data cannot toggle before this yellow dotted line for a duration known as setup-hold window. Occurrence of such an event is termed as hold violation. The consequence of such a violation can be capture of wrong data (better termed as hold check violation) or the sequential element going into meta-stable state (hold time violation).

| **Figure 2: A positive level-sensitive D-latch** |
**Latch hold time**: Figure 2 shows a positive level-sensitive latch. If there is a toggling of data at the latch input close to negative edge (while the latch is closing), there will be an uncertainty as if data will be capture reliably or not. For data to be captured reliably, next data must not reach Node C when closing edge of clock arrives at the input transmission gate. For this to happen, data must not travel NodeA -> NodeB -> NodeC before clock edge arrives. Data must change after this time interval only.
**Flip-flop hold time**: Figure 3 below shows a master-slave negative edge-triggered D flip-flop using transmission gate latches. This is the most popular configuration of a flip-flop used in today's designs. Let us get into the details of hold time for this flip-flop. For this flip-flop to capture data reliably, new data must not be present at **nodeD** at the arrival of negative edge of clock. So, data must not travel **NodeA -> NodeB -> NodeC -> NodeD** when clock edge arrives. For data to not reach NodeD when clock edge arrives, it must toggle after some interval A with respect to clock. This interval corresponds to hold time of the flip-flop.We can also say that the hold time of flip-flop is, in a way, hold time of master latch.

1.FF Hold time: So basically we do not want the new data to rush through at arrival of negative edge. Is this because of presence of old data or something?
2: Why time interval A ? Does this have to do anything with Inverter A delay?

Hi
1\. Yes, we want that old data is written after the clock edge has arrived. This corresponds to basic state machine functioning where each clock edge corresponds to a state.
2\. Yes, it means inverter A delay.

If Setup and Hold time time are associated with Master latch , then what is the use of slave latch with respect to timing analysis?

### 5. Liberty format : an introduction

**Date:** 2016-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/liberty-format-introduction.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/liberty-format-introduction.html)

### Liberty format : an introduction
**What is liberty format**: Liberty format is an industry standard format used to describe library cells of a particular technology. A cell could be a standard cell, IO Buffer, complex IP etc. Library cell description contains a lot of information like timing information, power estimation, other several attributes like area, functionality, operating condition etc. Speaking more technically, liberty format is a format to represent timing and power properties of black boxes (which we cant descend into). Liberty is an ASCII format, usually represented in a text file with extension " **.lib**". In this section, we will discuss timing aspects (delay and transition times) related to liberty format.
**How is liberty file populated with data**: The cells represented through liberty files are first simulated under a variety of conditions representative of actual design conditions that the cell may be exposed to. This process is known as characterization of library cells. As a very simple example, the delay of an inverter depends upon the input transition time and output load capacitance seen by it. The inverter will be characterized for a range of input transitions and output load capacitances. This characterization data, will then, be put into liberty in the form of a look-up table representing delay values at different transition times and load values.
To understand the different constructs related to timing in liberty file, let us take example of inverter. Rising transition at the input of inverter produces falling transition at the output of inverter and vice-versa. Hence there are two types of delay :
1. **Rise delay** : It is the propagation delay ( [see definition](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2014/07/propagation-delay.html)) between output and input when output changes from 0 to 1.
2. **Output fall delay** : It is the propagation delay between output and input when output is changing from 1 to 0.
In the real world, signal does not change its state from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 abruptly. It takes some time to change its state. Hence, delay is measured based upon the threshold points. Threshold points in the liberty file are specified as below:
**\#** threshold point of input falling edge
**input\_threshold\_pct\_fall**: 50.0 ;
\# threshold point of input rising edge
**input\_threshold\_pct\_rise**: 50.0 ;
#threshold point of output falling edge
**output\_threshold\_pct\_fall**: 50.0 ;
#threshold point of output rising edge
**output\_threshold\_pct\_rise**: 50.0 ;
**NOTE** : these values are in percentage. e.g. If vdd is 5v then all of the above values will be 2.5.
So, Output rise delay is time difference between output\_threshold\_pct\_rise and input\_threshold\_pct fall. Similarly Output fall delay is time difference between output\_threshold\_pct\_fall and input\_threshold\_pct\_rise.

**Transition time** : Time it takes for a signal to changes its state from one level to another level. Transition time is represented in terms of slew in liberty. Actually slew is inversely proportional to transition time. More the transition time, lesser is the slew rate and vice-versa. As we know that
voltage transition at the output is :
> V = Vdd \* \[ 1 - e^ ( -t/(RC ) ) \]
As Voltage equation is exponential, the voltage waveform is asymptotic at ends It is difficult to determine the exact start and end point of transition hence transition time is defined in terms of threshold values as follow :
\# lower threshold point for falling  edge
**slew\_lower\_threshold\_pct\_fall  :** 30;
\# upper threshold point for falling  edge
**slew\_upper\_threshold\_pct\_fall :** 30;
\# lower threshold point for rising  edge
**slew\_lower\_threshold\_pct\_rise :** 70;
\# upper threshold point for rising  edge
**slew\_upper\_threshold\_pct\_rise :** 70;

### 6. Reading from a file in tcl

**Date:** 2016-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/reading-from-file-in-tcl.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/reading-from-file-in-tcl.html)

### Reading from a file in tcl
It is very
common to read from and/or write to a file in any programming language. In tcl
also, one frequently uses file operations. **read**
command in tcl reads the entire file and stores it into a variable. One can,
then, perform the desired operations onto the read data. The normal command
sequence to read a file in tcl language is as below:
//
script to read and display contents
set
infile \[open _input\_file.rpt_ r\] // Create a file pointer and point it to the
file to be read
set
file\_data \[read $infile\]            //
Assign file\_data with contents of infile
close
$infile                                        //
Detach the file pointer from file to be read
set
lines \[split $file\_data “\\n”\]
//
Split the file contents by lines and assign each line to an element of list
foreach
element $lines {
                puts $element                  // Display each element of
$lines onto screen.
}

### 7. 2-input AND gate using 2:1 mux

**Date:** 2016-12

### 2-input AND gate using 2:1 mux
**2-input AND gate implementation using 2:1 mux**: Figure 1 below shows the truth table of a 2-input AND gate. If we observe carefully, OUT equals '0' when A is '0'. And OUT follows B when A is '1'. So, if we connect A to the select pin of a 2:1 mux, AND gate will be implemented if we connect D0 to '0' and D1 to 'B'.

**2-input NAND gate using 2:1 mux**: Figure 3 below shows the truth table of a 2-input NAND gate. If we observe carefully, OUT equals '1' when A is '0'. Similarly, when A is '1', OUT is B'. So, if we connect SEL pin of mux to A, D0 pin of mux to '1' and D1 to B', then it will act as a NAND gate.

### 9. 2-input OR gate using 2:1 mux

**Date:** 2016-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/OR-gate-using-mux.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/OR-gate-using-mux.html)

### 2-input OR gate using 2:1 mux
2-input OR gate using 2x1 mux: Figure 5 below shows the truth table for a 2-input OR gate. If we observe carefully, OUT equals B when A is '0'. Similarly, OUT is '1' (or A), when A is '1'. So, we can make a 2:1 mux act like a 2-input OR gate, if we connect D0 pin to B and D1 pin to A, with select connected to A.

### 10. 2-input XNOR gate using 2:1 mux

**Date:** 2016-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/XNOR-gate-using-mux.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/XNOR-gate-using-mux.html)

### 2-input XNOR gate using 2:1 mux
**2-input XNOR gate using 2x1 mux**: Figure 1 below shows the truth table of a 2-input XNOR gate. If we observe carefully, OUT equals B' when A is '0' and equals B when A is '1'. So, a 2-input XNOR gate can be implemented from a 2x1 mux, if we connect SEL pin to A, D0 to B' and D1 to B.

### 11. 8x1 multiplexer using 4x1 multiplexer

**Date:** 2016-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/8x1-mux-from-4x1-mux.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/8x1-mux-from-4x1-mux.html)

### 8x1 multiplexer using 4x1 multiplexer
An 8x1 mux can be implemented
using two 4x1 muxes and one 2x1 mux. 4 of the inputs can first be decoded using
each 4-input mux using two least significant select lines (S0 and S1). The
output of the two 4x1 muxes can be further multiplexed with the help of MSB of
select lines at further stage. The implementation of 8x1 using 4x1 and 2x1
muxes is shown in figure 1 below:

### 12. 2-input NOR gate using 2:1 mux

**Date:** 2016-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/NOR-gate-using-mux.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/NOR-gate-using-mux.html)

### 2-input NOR gate using 2:1 mux
**2-input NOR gate using 2x1 mux**: Figure 1 below shows the truth table of a 2-input NOR gate. If we observe carefully, OUT equal B' when A is '0'. Similarly, OUT equals '0' when A is '1'. So, we can make a 2-input mux act like a 2-input NOR gate, if we connect SEL of mux to A, D0 to B' and D1 to '0'.

### 13. Matchstick game bonanza!!

**Date:** 2016-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/matchstick-game-bonanza.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/matchstick-game-bonanza.html)

### Matchstick game bonanza!!
### **Problem: There are 'N' matchsticks placed on the table. You and your opponent are to pick any number of matchsticks between 1 and 5. Its your turn first. The one picking the last stick loses the game. You have to device a strategy such that you always win the game.** **Also, is there any starting number that cannot guarantee that you always win?**
**Solution**: Here, you have to ensure that the control of the game always remains in your hands. Let us approach this problem from the last. The last matchstick has to be picked by your opponent so as to ensure your win. So, your last turn must ensure that there must be only one matchstick left on the table. If this is not the case, say there are 2 matchsticks. Then, your opponent will pick 1 stick and you are left with only one stick to pick and lose the game.
Similarly, one turn before last of your opponent, there must be more than 6 sticks so that he cannot leave you with 1 stick by picking 5 of them. But if there are more than 7 sticks, he may leave you with the same situation by leaving 7 on the table. If you leave 7, the other can at max pick 5 and min 1 leaving any number between 6 and 2 on the table. You can now pick the desired number leaving the last stick to be picked by him. Now, if there were 8 sticks on the table, your opponent would pick 1 leaving you with 7 sticks. :-( Similarly, one turn before, you should have left 13 sticks on the table.
So, your approach should be to leave (6M + 1) sticks on the table always. Ensure that at the end of each round, 6 less matchsticks are there on the table. (For instance, if your opponent picks 3 sticks, you also pick 3).
But there is a catch in this game, if there are already (6M + 1) sticks on the table initially, and its your turn first, you cannot ensure after your first turn the winning strategy. Now, the control goes into the hand of your opponent and you are at the verge of losing the game.
Similarly, 5 can be replaced with any number 'K'. At the end of each turn, you have to ensure there are (K+1)M + 1 sticks left on the table.

### 14. 2-input XOR gate using 2:1 mux

**Date:** 2016-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/XOR-gate-using-mux.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/XOR-gate-using-mux.html)

### 2-input XOR gate using 2:1 mux
**2-input XOR gate using 2x1 mux**: Figure 1 shows the truth table for a 2-input XOR gate where A and B are the two inputs and OUT is equal to XOR of A and B. If we observe carefully, OUT equals B when A is '0' and B' when A is '1'. So, a 2:1 mux can be used to implement 2-input XOR gate if we connect SEL to A, D0 to B and D1 to B'.

### 15. NOT gate using 2:1 mux

### NOT gate using 2:1 mux
NOT gate using 2:1 mux: Figure 13 shows the truth table for a NOT gate. The only inverting path in a multiplexer is from select to output. To implement NOT gate with the help of a mux, we just need to enable this inverting path. This will happen if we connect D0 to '1' and D1 to '0'.

We can also say that we need to propagate '0' to output when input (select) is 1 and '1' when input is '0'. Figure 14 shows the implementation of NOT gate using 2x1 mux:

### 16. Zero cycle paths

**Date:** 2016-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/zero-cycle-path.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/12/zero-cycle-path.html)

### Zero cycle paths
**Zero cycle path**: A zero cycle timing path is a representative of race condition between data and clock. A zero cycle path is one in which data is launched and captured on the same edge of the clock. In other words, setup check for a zero cycle path is zero cycle, i.e., it is on the same edge as the one launching data. Hold check, then, will be one cycle before the edge at which data is launched. Figure 1 below shows the setup check and hold check for a zero cycle timing path.
|     |
| [![In a zero cycle path, setup check is zero cycle. In other words, it is on the same edge as of launch clock.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhm79h2eTFVeffcsMlY9LQcdOT3NUMk3kCE6hmcUdmeBQeHGm-ZwTeaYNpldwBkt9daC0Th5fYAAGwjMPJUAYwmWv3VMkaZ7W56hZRK3dcAYqy2KHs2GpqSDFvsCamlmoj6PEZ5ihIAvAkT/s640/zero_cycle_path.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhm79h2eTFVeffcsMlY9LQcdOT3NUMk3kCE6hmcUdmeBQeHGm-ZwTeaYNpldwBkt9daC0Th5fYAAGwjMPJUAYwmWv3VMkaZ7W56hZRK3dcAYqy2KHs2GpqSDFvsCamlmoj6PEZ5ihIAvAkT/s1600/zero_cycle_path.png) |
| **Figure 1: Setup check and hold check for zero cycle paths** |
**How to specify zero cycle path**: As we know, by default, setup check is single cycle (is checked on the next edge with respect to the one on which data is launched). If the FSM requires a timing path to be zero cycle, it has to be specified using the SDC command "set\_multicycle\_path".
|     |
| [![Default setup check for a timing path is single cycle, whereas hold check is zero cycle.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsIRE-VSV3Jwt8W3J-vw9N9kCY5w_zT9N67F2nUjQVr6H_9A9FVHybunsOlVokT2GRMJsa0Q3lgxathpCW8Z5Kj5_bO-EBx6oEOuWNARtOPVA431qWGZ5hyphenhyphenLlum5oANhneYjxPoOt-qd-x/s640/default+setup+hold+checks.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsIRE-VSV3Jwt8W3J-vw9N9kCY5w_zT9N67F2nUjQVr6H_9A9FVHybunsOlVokT2GRMJsa0Q3lgxathpCW8Z5Kj5_bO-EBx6oEOuWNARtOPVA431qWGZ5hyphenhyphenLlum5oANhneYjxPoOt-qd-x/s1600/default+setup+hold+checks.png) |
| **Figure 2: Default setup and hold checks for single cycle timing path** |
The default setup and hold check for same edge timing paths is single cycle and zero cycle as shown in figure 2 above. To model it as a zero cycle path (as in figure 1), we need to apply following timing constraint:
> **_set\_multicycle\_path 0 -setup -from <startpoint> -to <endpoint>_**
where <startpoint> is the the flip-flop which launches the data and <endpoint> is the flip-flop which captures the data. In other words, as viewed from application perspective, zero cycle path is one of the special cases of a multi-cycle path only. Above multicycle constraint modifies the setup check to be zero cycle. Hold check also, shifts one edge back.

hii...if there are violations in setup for zero cycle path...how that can be closed? because we dont get enough margin.?

Hi Deva
That will be a race condition between clock and data. The only possible solution is to have skew more than data path.

It all depends upon the architecture, and an RTL designer can come up with such a case. In reality, zero cycle setup paths are not so uncommon.

### 17. 2x1 mux using NAND gates

**Date:** 2016-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/2x1-mux-using-nand-gates.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/2x1-mux-using-nand-gates.html)

### 2x1 mux using NAND gates
As we know, the logical equation of a 2-input mux is given as below:
> **Y = (s' A   +    s B)**
Where s is the select of the multiplexer.
De-Morgan's law states that
**m + n = (m'n')'**
Taking this into account, here **m = s'A** and **n = sB**
> **Y = ((s'A)'(sB)')'** **= ((s' A)'  (s B)')'**
Thus, Y is equal to **((s' nand A) nand (s nand B)).** No further optimizations seem possible to this logic. Figure 1 below shows the implementation of 2:1 mux using 2-input NAND gates.

Hi Rama
Clock gating cells are added both during RTL design as well as during synthesis. RTL designer may add clock gating cells for clock control and division as well as for power saving. On the other hand, those added during synthesis are purely for power saving.

Every design element (logic gate) in clock path which has more than two pins is a candidate clock gate. By more than two pins, we mean non-buffer non-inverter cells in clock path.

### 19. XNOR gate using NAND

**Date:** 2016-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/xnor-gate-using-nand.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/xnor-gate-using-nand.html)

### XNOR gate using NAND
As we know, the logical equation of a 2-input XNOR gate is given as below:
> **Y = A (xnor) B = (A' B '   +    A B)**
Let us take an approach where we consider **A** and **A'** as different variables for now (optimizations related to this, if any, will consider later). Thus, the logic equation, now, becomes:
> **Y = (CD    +    A B)           -----   (i)**
> where
> C = A'     and      D = B'
De-Morgan's law states that
**m + n = (m'n')'**
Taking this into account,
> **Y = ((CD)'(AB)')'** **= ((A' B')'  (A B)')'**
Thus, Y is equal to **((A' nand B') nand (A nand B)).** No further optimizations to the logic seem possible to this logic. Figure 1 below shows the implementation of XOR gate using 2-input NAND gates.

"Thus, Y is equal to ((A' nand B) nand (A nand B')). "
Shouldn't it be ((A' nand B') nand (A nand B))?

### 20. 3-input AND gate using 4:1 mux

**Date:** 2016-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/3-input-and-gate-using-41-mux.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/3-input-and-gate-using-41-mux.html)

### 3-input AND gate using 4:1 mux
As we know, a AND gate's output goes '1' when all its inputs are '1', otherwise it is '0'. The truth table for a 3-input AND gate is shown below in figure 1, where A, B and C are the three inputs and O is the output.
> **O = A (and) B (and) C**
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEieoseSaLuCr60pRIGouR6sW_uuIOn3korxIeVa69dYWltVKfYgrVaGEMbCUwsXqwT9bdMsALs622Ge7IqCNEQDL0-rhFDDV-9LSPeTGIQJmWqtdnMwFS3rTOnt5uCBOQQMlWgBQUQ92raK/s400/3-input+and+truth+table.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEieoseSaLuCr60pRIGouR6sW_uuIOn3korxIeVa69dYWltVKfYgrVaGEMbCUwsXqwT9bdMsALs622Ge7IqCNEQDL0-rhFDDV-9LSPeTGIQJmWqtdnMwFS3rTOnt5uCBOQQMlWgBQUQ92raK/s1600/3-input+and+truth+table.png) |
| **Truth table for 3-input AND gate** |
A 4:1 mux has 2 select lines. We can connect A and B to each of the select lines. The output will, then, be a function of the third input C. Now, if we sub-partition the truth table for distinct values of A and B, we observe
> **_When A = 0 and B = 0, O = 0 => Connect D0 pin of mux to '0'_**
> **_When A = 0 and B = 1, O = 0 => Connect D1 pin of mux to '0'_**
> **_When A = 1 and B = 0, O = 0 => Connect D2 pin of mux to '0'_**
> **_When A = 1 and B = 1, O = C => Connect D3 pin of mux to C_**
The implementation of 3-input AND gate, based upon our discussion so far, is as shown in figure 2 below:

### 21. 3-input XOR gate using 2-input XOR gates

**Date:** 2016-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/3-input-xor-gate-using-2-input-xor-gates.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/3-input-xor-gate-using-2-input-xor-gates.html)

### 3-input XOR gate using 2-input XOR gates
A 3-input XOR gate can be implemented using 2-input XOR gates by cascading 2 2-input XOR gates. Two of the three inputs will feed one of the 2-input XOR gates. The output of the first gate will, then, be XORed with the third input to get the final output.
Let us say, we want to XOR three inputs A,B and C to get the output Z. First, XOR A and B together to obtain intermediate output Y. Then XOR Y and C to obtain Z. The schematic representation to obtain 3-input XOR gate by cascading 2-input XOR gates is shown in figure below:

This returns 1 if all 3 inputs are 1. It's a parity gate, not XOR.

Hi
Yes, the most accepted functionality of a multi-input XOR gate is as an odd-parity checker. :-)

### 23. Why NAND structures are preferred over NOR ones?

**Date:** 2016-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/universal-gates.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/universal-gates.html)

### Why NAND structures are preferred over NOR ones?
Both NAND and NOR are classified as universal gates, but we see that NAND is preferred over NOR in CMOS logic structures. Let us discuss why it is so:
We know that when output is at logic 1, pull up structure for the output stage is on and it provides a path from VDD to output. Similarly, pull down structure provides a path from GND to output when output is logic 0. Pull up and pull down resistances are one of major factor in determining the speed of cell. The inverse of pull up and pull down resistances are called **output high drive** and **output low drive** of the cell respectively. In general, cells are designed to have similar drive strength of pull up and pull down structures to have comparable rise and fall time.
NMOS has half the resistance of an equal sized PMOS. let us say resistance of a given sized NMOS is R then resistance of  PMOS of same size will be 2R. In NAND gate, two NMOS are connected in series and two PMOS are connected in parallel. So, pull up and pull down resistances will be:
            Pull up resistance = 2R \|\| 2R = R
            Pull down resistance = R + R = 2R
On the other hand, in a NOR gate, two NMOS are connected in parallel and two PMOS are connected in series. The pull-up and pull-down resistances, now, will be:
            Pull up resistance = 2R + 2R = 4R
            Pull down resistance = R \|\| R = R/2
NAND gate has better ratio of output high drive and output low drive as compared to NOR gate. Hence NAND gate is preferred over NOR.
To use NOR gate as universal gate either pull up or pull down structure has to be resized(decrease the length of PMOS cells or increase length of NMOS cells) to have similar resistance as resistance is directly proportional to length (length of channel here).

### 24. Divide by 2 clock in VHDL

**Date:** 2016-11

### Divide by 2 clock in VHDL
Clock dividers
are ubiquitous circuits used in every digital design. A divide-by-N divider
produces a clock that is N times lesser frequency as compared to input clock. A
flip-flop with its inverted output fed back to its input serves as a
divide-by-2 circuit. Figure 1 shows the schematic representation for the same.

Xilinx's vivado tools won't allow an output to be used internally as an input, so clk\_out <= not clk\_out is disallowed. I believe this is, more generally, a VHDL rule. To accommodate this, the architecture might become:
architecture Behavioral of div2 is
signal clk\_state : std\_logic;
begin
process (clk\_in,reset)
begin
if reset = '1' then
clk\_state <= '0';
elsif clk\_in'event and clk\_in = '1' then
clk\_state <= not clk\_state;
end if;
end process;
clk\_out <= clk\_state;
end Behavioral;

### 25. Applications of latches

**Date:** 2016-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/latch-applications.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/latch-applications.html)

### Applications of latches
A latch is a level-sensitive storage element capable of storing 1-bit digital data ( [Read more about basics of latches here](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/latch-principle.html)). However simple that may sound, but there are countless applications in digital VLSI circuits as discussed below:
- **Master-slave flip-flop**: Cascading of a positive latch and negative latch gives a negative edge-triggered flip-flop and cascading of negative and positve latch gives a positive edge-triggered flip-flop. This kind of design of edge-triggered flip-flops is the most prevalent architecture used in VLSI industry. In other words, all the flip-flops used in today's designs are actually two latches cascaded back-to-back.

| **Figure 1: Master-slave flip-flops using latches** |
- **Latch as lockup element**: A latch is used as a savior for scan hold timing closure in the form of lockup latch. A lockup latch is nothing more than a transparent latch used in places where hold timing is an issue due to either very large clock skew or uncommon path, one of the commonoly occuring scenarios being scan connection between two functionally non-interacting domains.

- **Latches used for permormance gain**: Latches, due to their inherent property of time borrowing, can capture data over a period of time, rather than at a particular instant. This property of latch can be taken advantage of by the stage having maximum delay borrowing time from next stage; thus, reducing overall clock period. [Read more here](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2017/12/latch-performance-gain.html)
- **Latch pipeline**: Going one step further, there can be a whole design implemented with latches. The basic principle used is that a positive latch must be succeeded by a negative latch, and vice-versa. Using a latch based design, we can effectively get the job done at half the clock frequency. But, it is not feasible to fulfil the requirement of positive latch output going to negative latch. The effort required to build even a small latch based pipeline (even as small as that shown below in figure 2) is very latge. That is why, we never see practically latch pipeline based circuits.

- **Integrated Clock Gating Cell:** Latch is used in the path of enable signal in case of clock gating elements in order to avoid glitches. An AND gate, in general, requires enable to launch from negative edge-triggered flip-flop and vice-versa. But it is very difficult to generalize a state-machine. Hence, latches are embedded alongside the AND gate (or OR gate) as a single standard cell to be used at places where clock gating is required. [Read more here.](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/integrated-clock-gating-cell.html)
- **Latches in memory arrays to store data:** Regenerative latches are used inside memory arrays of SRAM to store data. Regenerative latch, in general, forms part of a memory bit-cell. The number of such bit cells is equal to the number of bits that the memory can store.
So, we have gone through a few of the applications of latches. Can you think of any other application of latches in designs? Please do not hesitate to share your knowledge with others. :-)

1\. Latch is used on clock gate enable path to avoid glitches.
2\. to store entry bits in memory arrays.

### 27. Clock gating - basics

**Date:** 2016-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/clock-gating.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/clock-gating.html)

### Clock gating - basics
The dynamic power associated with any circuit is related to the amount of switching activity and the total capacitive load. In digital VLSI designs, the most frequently switching element are clock elements (buffers and other gates used to transport clock signal to all the synchronous elements in the design). **In some of the designs, clock switching power may be contributing as high as 50% of the total power**. Power being a very critical aspect, we need to make efforts to reduce this. Any effort that can be made to save the clock elements toggling can help in reducing the total power by a significant amount. Clock gating is one of the techniques used to save the dynamic power of clock elements in the design.
**Principle behind clock gating**: The principle behind clock gating is to stop the clock of those sequential elements whose data is not toggling. RTL level code talks only about data transfer. It may have some condition wherein a flip-flop will not toggle its output if that condition is met. Figure 1 below shows such a condition. In it, FF1's output will remain stable as long as EN = 0. On the right hand side, its equivalent circuit is provided, wherein EN has been translated into an AND gate in the clock path.This is a very simplistic version of what modern-day synthesis tools do to implement clock gating.

| **Figure 1: Clock gating implementation** |
**Implications of clock gating**: The implementation of clock gating, as expected, is not so simple. There are multiple things to be taken into account, some of which are:
- **Timing of enable (EN) signal**: The gating of clock can cause a glitch in clock, if not taken care of by architectural implementation. [Clock gating checks](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/05/clock-switching-and-clock-gating-checks.html) discusses what all needs to be taken care of as regards timing in clock gating implementation.
**Area/power/latency trade-off**: As is shown in figure 1, clock gating transfers a data-path logic into clock path. This can increase overall clock latency. Also, area penalty can be there, if the area of clock gating structure is more. Power can also increase, instead of decreasing, if only 1-2 flops' structure is replaced by clock gating (depending upon the switching power of clock gating structure vs those inside flip-flop). Normally, a bunch of flops with similar EN condition are chosen, and a common clock gating is inserted for those, thereby minimizing area and power penalties.

i think clock gates would save on area too, as many muxes before the flops are avoided,
generally there is a min bandwidth in synthesis, usually 3, below which syntheis tool will not insert clock gating,

Yes, clock gating saves on area as well as power if the ratio of muxes saved to clock gating cells inserted is high.

Hi,
Is that possible to reduce the duty cycle of clock from 50% to 30% or even less than that? This in-turn reduce the duration of time for which the transistor is being ON and consecutively leads to dynamic power saving. Correct me if am wrong.
Thanks in advance

Hi
CMOS structure is such that there is no path from VDD to GND when input (let us assume clock here) is stable. So, duty cycle will not have any impact in case of CMOS.
Let us assume we are designing exclusively with NMOS such that high time of the clock means transistors being ON. In that case too, there are equal number of positive and negative latches in the design (a positive flip flop is a negative latch followed by a positive latch). Thus, although your idea is good, but would not be of much help. :-)

Our designs, byu default, consider "0" as the inactive state of clock. This can be achieved by an AND gate, wherein if enable is 0, output is also 0.
In case of an OR gate, output inactive state will be "1".

### 28. Setup time

**Date:** 2016-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/setup-time.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/11/setup-time.html)

### Setup time
**Definition of setup time**: Setup time is defined as the minimum amount of time before arrival of clock's active edge so that it can be latched properly. In other words, each flip-flop (or any sequential element, in general) needs data to be stable for some time before arrival of clock edge such that it can reliably capture the data. This amount of time is known as **_setup time._**
We can also link setup time with state transitions. We know that the data to be captured at the current clock edge was launched at previous clock edge by some other flip-flop. The data launched at previous clock edge must be stable  at least setup time before the current clock edge. So, adherence to setup time ensures that the data launched at previous edge is captured at the current clock edge reliably. In other words, setup time ensures that the design transitions to next state smoothly.

| **Figure 1: Setup time** |
Figure 1 shows that data is allowed to toggle prior to yellow dotted line. This yellow dotted line corresponds to setup time. The time difference between this line and active clock edge is termed as **setup time.** Data cannot toggle after this yellow dotted line for a duration known as setup-hold window. Occurrence of such an event will be termed as setup time violation. The consequence of setup time violation can be capture of wrong data or the sequential element (setup check violation) going into metastable state (setup time violation).

| **Figure 2: A positive level-sensitive D-latch** |
**Latch setup time**: Figure 2 shows a positive level-sensitive latch. If there is a toggling of data at the latch input close to negative edge (while the latch is closing), there will be an uncertainty as if data will be capture reliably or not. For data to be captured reliably, it has to be available at the input of loop transmission gate at the arrival of closing clock edge. To be able to present at NodeD at the closing edge, it must be there at latch input some time prior to the clock edge. This time in reaching from latch input to NodeD is termed as setup time for this latch.
**Flip-flop setup time**: Figure 3 below shows a master-slave negative edge-triggered D flip-flop using transmission gate latches. This is the most popular configuration of a flip-flop used in today's designs. Let us get into the details of setup time for this flip-flop. For this flip-flop to capture data reliably, the data must be present at **nodeF** at the arrival of negative edge of clock. So, data must travel **NodeA -> NodeB -> NodeC -> NodeD -> NodeE -> NodeF** before clock edge arrives. To reach **NodeF** at the closing edge of latch1, data should be present at **NodeA** at some earlier time. This time taken by data to reach **NodeF** is the setup time for flip-flop under consideration (assuming CLK and CLK' are present instantaneously. If that is not the case, it will be accounted for accordingly). We can also say that the setup time of flip-flop is, in a way, setup time of master latch.

### 29. Clock gating cell

**Date:** 2016-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/integrated-clock-gating-cell.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/integrated-clock-gating-cell.html)

### Clock gating cell
Clock gating is
a very common technique to save power by stopping the clock to a module when
the module is not operating. As discussed in [Clock\\
switching and clock gating checks](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2014/05/clock-switching-and-clock-gating-checks.html), there are two kinds of clock gating
checks at combinational gates. We also discussed that for an AND type check,
enable must launch from a negative edge-triggered flip-flop and for an OR type
check, enable must launch from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop. However, it
is very difficult to control the generic state machine to launch the signals to
gate a clock either all from positive edge or from negative edge.
**Evolution of integrated clock gating**
**cell**: To reduce the burden of same kind of launch registers from the
state machine, an AND type clock gate can always be preceded with a negative
level-sensitive latch and an OR type clock gate can be preceded with a positive
level-sensitive latch. This has the same impact as a [lockup\\
latch](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2013/06/lockup-latches-soul-mate-of-scan-based.html) in case of scan chain and eases hold timing. It results in zero cycle
hold check from both positive and negative edge-triggered registers, without
introduction of any additional latency. Since, each clock gate has to be
preceded by a latch, why not build a special cell with an AND gate + a negative
level-sensitive latch (or an OR gate + a positive level-sensitive latch). This concept served as motivation for **Integrated Clock Gating Cell**. This
will provide more optimum area, power and timing for the resulting structure.
**Test enable pin in integrated clock**
**gating cell**: During shift in scan testing, all the clock control signals
have to be bypassed to let shifting happen. This can be achieved by providing a
bypass signal called “test enable” that is ORed with functional enable signal (shown in figure 1 below).
As soon as design goes into shift mode, test enable signal goes high, thereby
bypassing all functional enable signals. So, it makes sense to embed this OR
gate into integrated clock gating cell itself.
**Structure of integrated clock gating**
**cell**: Figure 1 below shows the structure of the two kinds of integrated
clock gating cells. The one on the left has an AND gate preceded by a negative
level-sensitive latch. The enable and test\_enable are active high. Clock\_out
has an inactive low state. The one on the right is complementary to this. It
has an OR gate preceded by a positive level-sensitive latch. Both enable and
test\_enable are active high and output clock has an inactive high state. In case enable and test\_enable are active low, NOR gate should be replaced by AND gate.

In second ICG in place of NAND gate should use AND gate.

Hi
For first ICG, to enable the clock, because of AND gate between clock and enable, you need "1" at the output of latch. So, if either of "func\_enable" or "test\_enable" is 1, clock will pass through.
For second ICG, to enable the clock, because of OR gate, you need to send "0" to its input. So, when either of "func\_enable" or "test\_enable" is "1", latch output should be "0". Which translates to NAND gate

Shouldn't it be a NOR gate instead in the OR Gating Check? Since the ICG is active low, we would want the clock to be present at the o/p when either Enable or Test\_Enable are 0. In this example, we require that both Enable and Test\_Enable be high before the latch can actually activate the clock.

You mentioned "It results in zero cycle hold check from both positive and negative edge-triggered registers, without introduction of any additional latency". For negative edge-triggered register, hold check would be relaxed by T/2, for positive it would be zero. Can you please confirm?

Correct, it would simply behave like a positive edge triggered flop in terms of timing behaviour.

### 31. STA problem: Checking for setup/hold violations in a timing path

**Date:** 2016-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/setup-hold-check-example.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/setup-hold-check-example.html)

### STA problem: Checking for setup/hold violations in a timing path
|     |
| **Problem**: Figure 1 below shows a timing path from positive edge-triggered register to a positive edge-triggered register. Can you figure out if there is any setup and/or hold violation in the following circuit?<br> [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXHv_pJBQ-Ay6_p8DifACulpiJpngcC9xpai7yeRwyKbbSI8zHtasUNzBQBm2w1R1pw2QbPt_Tj-u9utd7ywtOWEorvkcI52T2b9MEKUJIt5hX1z1ZATj17yhWBdxgPNO7ADfZj3U0jXKY/s640/setup_hold_example_1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXHv_pJBQ-Ay6_p8DifACulpiJpngcC9xpai7yeRwyKbbSI8zHtasUNzBQBm2w1R1pw2QbPt_Tj-u9utd7ywtOWEorvkcI52T2b9MEKUJIt5hX1z1ZATj17yhWBdxgPNO7ADfZj3U0jXKY/s1600/setup_hold_example_1.png) |
| **Figure 1: A sample timing path** |
**Solution**:
To check if a timing path violates setup and/or hold, we need to check if they satisfy setup and hold equations. A violating timing path has a negative setup/hold slack value.
The above circuit has a positive clock skew of 1 ns (as capture flip-flop gets clock 1 ns later than launch flip-flop).
Let us first check for setup violation. As we know, for a full cycle register-to-register timing path, setup equation is given as:
> **Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup \- Tskew < Tperiod**
> Here,
> **Tck->q = 2 ns,  Tprop (max value of combinational propagation delay) = 4 ns,  Tsetup = 1 ns, Tperiod** **= 10 ns,** **Tskew = 1 ns**
> Now, **Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup  = 2 + 4 + 1 - 1 = 6 ns <** **Tperiod**
So, the above circuit does not have a setup violation. The setup slack, in this case, will be given as:
> SS = **Tperiod -** **(Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup** **\- Tskew** **)**
> SS = +4 ns
Since, setup slack comes out to be positive, this path does not have a setup violation.
Now, let us check is there is a hold violation for this timing path. Hold timing equation is given as:
> **Tck->q** **\+ Tprop** **\> Thold \+ Tskew**
> Here,
> **Tck->q** **=  2 ns, Tprop** **(min value of combinational propagation delay) = 2 ns, Thold = 2ns, Tskew** **= 1 ns**
> Now, **Tck->q** **\+ Tprop** **= 2 ns + 2 ns = 4 ns**
> And **Thold \+ Tskew** **= 2 ns + 1 ns = 3 ns**
Now, 4 ns > 3 ns, so this circuit does not have a hold violation. The hold slack, in this case, will be given as:
> HS = **Tck->q** **\+ Tprop** **\- (Thold \+ Tskew**)  = +1 ns
Since, hold slack comes out to be positive, this path does not have a hold violation.

Time period of clock is not given in question but in solution it is taken as 10ns. I also seen questions where time period is not given, and we want to find whether setup time violation exist or not. So my question is how we can take clock period to find setup time constrain (if period is not mention in question).

Hi Harshit
The time period is mentioned in the figure in this post. You got to know time period to calculate setup slack, unless it is a zero cycle setup check. :-)

Hii Harshith,
If time period is not given, then either frequency or slack will be given.. So you can calculate the Required time.. But in this case, RT is mentioned in the pic..

### 32. Mice and poisonous bottles

**Date:** 2016-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/mice-and-poisonous-bottles.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/mice-and-poisonous-bottles.html)

### Mice and poisonous bottles
**Problem: There are 20 bottles filled with water, out of which exactly one is poisonous. We have to figure out the poisonous one. We have, with us, available some mice. When a mice tastes water from a bottle, it dies after exactly half an hour. We have one hour to figure out the poisonous bottle. What approach we should take.**(Problem source : www.quora.com)
**Solution:** Each bottle can either be drunk from by a mice or not; i.e., there are two possibilities. We can interpret this as a binary number system problem wherein '1' represents that the mice has drunk from a bottle and '0' represents it has not.
Now, let us approach with a **very simple but un-optimized** method. Let us have 20 mice, and assign 1 mice to each bottle (1 mice will dring water from a bottle). After half an hour, one of the mice will die. Clearly, we have the culprit bottle. This solution requires 20 mice. But, we can have a better solution as discussed below. Another option can be to choose 1 mouse only. Let it drink from one bottle, wait for half an hour if it dies. If not, let it drink from next bottle. The maximum this approach can take is 10 hours, which is way more than the budget allocated. So, solution 2 is not for this problem.
To represent number 20, we need 5 binary digits. Let us number each bottle with numbers from 1 to 20 and assign binary code representing that number to the bottle. Now, each of the bottles has a unique 5 bit code. We can assume each bit representative of 1 mouse, '1' shows that the mouse will drink water from this bottle, '0' shows otherwise.
Let us take an example. Bottle '12' will have code '01100', meaning that mouse 2 and 3 will drink water from it. The code for each bottle and respective interpretation is as shown below:
> |     |     |     |
> | Bottle no | Code | Interpretation |
> | 1 | "00000" | No mouse will drink<br> water |
> | 2 | "00001" | Mouse 1 will dring<br> water |
> | 3 | "00010" | Mouse 2 will drink<br> water |
> | 4 | "00011" | Mouse 1 and 2 will<br> drink water |
> | 5 | "00100" | Mouse 3 will drink<br> water |
> | 6 | "00101" | Mouse 1 and 3 will<br> drink water |
> | 7 | "00110" | Mouse 2 and 3 will<br> drink water |
> | 8 | "00111" | Mouse 1,2 and 3 will<br> drink water |
> | 9 | "01000" | Mouse 4 will drink<br> water |
> | 10 | "01001" | Mouse 1 and 4 will<br> drink water |
> | 11 | "01010" | Mouse 2 and 4 will<br> drink water |
> | 12 | "01011" | Mouse 1, 2 and 4 will<br> drink water |
> | 13 | "01100" | Mouse 3 and 4 will<br> drink water |
> | 14 | "01101" | Mouse 1, 3 and 4 will<br> drink water |
> | 15 | "01110" | Mouse 2, 3 and 4 will<br> drink water |
> | 16 | "01111" | Mouse 1, 2, 3 and 4<br> will drink water |
> | 17 | "10000" | Mouse 5 will drink<br> water |
> | 18 | "10001" | Mouse 1 and 5 will<br> drink water |
> | 19 | "10010" | Mouse 2 and 5 will<br> drink water |
> | 20 | "10011" | Mouse 1, 2 and 5 will<br> drink water |
Let us say, bottle 15 had poison. So, after half an hour,  mouse 2, 3 and 4 will die as only these mice drank water from this bottle, with the help of which we will come to know that this bottle contained poison.

I initially thought we have a timer. Then one mouse is enough. We will let him drink from numbered bottles (from 0 to 19) with frequency once in a minute. Then the poisoned bottle will be: (timeDead - 30). In the worst case, when the poisoned bottle is the last, it will be discovered after 49 minutes, which complies to time budget.

### 33. Implement 3-input gates using 2:1 muxes

**Date:** 2016-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/implement-3-input-gates-using-21-muxes.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/implement-3-input-gates-using-21-muxes.html)

### Implement 3-input gates using 2:1 muxes
The implementation of 3-input gates using 2:1 muxes requires two stages of multiplexing logic as there is only 1 select line for a mux. Two of the variables can form as the select, one for each stage multiplexers. And the third input can act as the input of the first stage multiplexers depending upon the function needed. In this post, we will illustrate the process building a 3-input AND gate and a 3-input OR gate using 2:1 muxes:
**3-input AND gate using 2:1 muxes**: As we know, a AND gate's output goes '1' when all its inputs are '1', otherwise it is '0'. The truth table for a 3-input AND gate is shown below in figure 1, where A, B and C are the three inputs and O is the output.
> **O = A (and) B (and) C**

| **Truth table for 3-input AND gate** |
If we observe carefully, when A is 0, output is '0'. And when A is 1, output depends upon combination of B and C. So, we need at least two 2:1 muxes to implement 3-input AND gate. The mux closest to output can have A connected to the select, data0 input can be connected to '0'. data1 input needs to be connected to another mux that implements sub-function of B and C.
Now, if we observe the rows with A=1, when B = 0, O = 0. And when B = 1, O = C. So, to implement the sub-function, we need to connect B to select of mux, data0 of mux should be connected to '0' and data1 should be connected to 'C'.
Figure 2 below shows the implementation of 3-input AND gate using 2:1 muxes.

| **3-input AND gate using 2:1 muxes** |
3-input OR gate using 2:1 muxes: The output of an OR gate is '0' when all the inputs are '0', otherwise it is '1'. The truth table of a 3-input OR gate is shown in figure 3 below:

| **Truth table for 3-input OR gate** |
Looking at the truth table of 3-input OR gate, we see that when A = '1', output also goes '1'. And when A is '0', output is a sub-function of B and C. Seeing at the highlighted portion, when B = 0, output is equal to C. And when B is '1', output is also '1'.
Thus, we can connect the select of output side mux to A, with D0 input connected to another mux implementing sub-function of B and C and D1 input to '1'. The select of mux implementing sub-function can be connected to B, D0 to C and D1 to '1'.
Figure 4 below shows the implementation of 3-input OR gate using 2:1 muxes:

**3-input NAND gate using 2:1 mux**: A NAND gate's output is 0 when all the inputs are 1. For all other combinations of inputs, the output is 1. The truth table for a 3-input NAND gate is shown in figure below.

| **Truth table for 3-input NAND gate** |
Let us choose to have a 2:1 mux decoding the value of A. So, the mux closest to output will have its select connected to A. When A = 0, output is 1. So, pin D1 needs to be connected to "1". When A is 1, output is a further function of B and C. So, we need another mux. Let us choose to have B decode the value; i.e. B at the select of mux. When B = 0 & A = 1, O = 1. When B = 1 & A = 1, O = C'. The resulting logic using 2:1 muxes for a 3-input NAND gate is shown in figure below.

| **Truth table for 3-input NOR Gate** |
Let us choose A to be the select of mux closest to output. When A is "1", output is "0". So, input-1 of the mux will be connected to logic "0". When A is "0", output is further a function of B and C.
Now, looking at the rows where A is "0", let us choose B to select the logic. When B is 1, output is "0" and when B is "0", output is invert of C. Thus, input-1 of this mux will be connected to "0" and other input to C'. Below figure shows the implementation of 3-input NOR gate using 2:1 muxes.

Let us choose A to be the select of mux closest to output. When A is "0", output is a function of B and C. So, we need another mux, let us choose B to be the select of this mux. Among the rows with A = 0, when B is "0", output is equal to C and when B is "1", output is equal to C'.
Similarly among the rows with A = "1", when B is "0", output is equal to C' and when B is "1", output is equal to C. The implementation of 3-input XOR gate using 2:1 muxes is shown in figure below.

i think xnor implementation is wrong . to make it correct we have to interchange the connection of mux which acts as input for the next mux

### 34. How to build an XOR gate using NAND gates

**Date:** 2016-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/xor-using-nand.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/xor-using-nand.html)

### How to build an XOR gate using NAND gates
We can build a 2-input XOR gate using 5 NAND gates. Sound interesting, isn't it? Let us see how.
As we know, the logical equation of a 2-input XOR gate is given as below:
> **Y = A (xor) B = (A' B    +    A B')**
Let us take an approach where we consider **A** and **A'** as different variables for now (optimizations related to this, if any, will consider later). Thus, the logic equation, now, becomes:
> **Y = (CB    +    A D)           -----   (i)**
> where
> C = A'     and      D = B'
De-Morgan's law states that
**m + n = (m'n')'**
Taking this into account,
> **Y = ((CB)'(AD)')'** **= ((A' B)'  (A B')')'**
Thus, Y is equal to **((A' nand B) nand (A nand B')).** No further optimizations to the logic seem possible to this logic. Figure 1 below shows the implementation of XOR gate using 2-input NAND gates.

Thus, we have seen an XOR gate can be implemented by putting NAND gates in cascade. Can you think of a better way of implementing XOR gate using NAND gates?

### 35. STA problem: Maximum frequency of operation of a timing path

**Date:** 2016-10

### STA problem: Maximum frequency of operation of a timing path
|     |
| **Problem**: Figure 1 below shows a timing path from a positive edge-triggered register to a positive edge-triggered register. Can you figure out the maximum frequency of operation for this path?<br> [![find out the maximum frequency of operation for path shown](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4stO2HPdq3Z3R_0pa0w0XaVoKHlWh_WAF9yiZRsQ77eo1yBi5CW2rL1f4llb-cVQb1qRBayDYA1nDrUm6YXJ9Q5IvIZzOtWq1UWwdScvPMeth2Os-EqTTgiMu3j2SBuaxNZAoFX2rvfkz/s640/max_freq.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4stO2HPdq3Z3R_0pa0w0XaVoKHlWh_WAF9yiZRsQ77eo1yBi5CW2rL1f4llb-cVQb1qRBayDYA1nDrUm6YXJ9Q5IvIZzOtWq1UWwdScvPMeth2Os-EqTTgiMu3j2SBuaxNZAoFX2rvfkz/s1600/max_freq.png) |
| **Figure 1: A sample timing path** |
**Solution**:
The above timing path is a single cycle timing path. The maximum frequency is governed by setup timing equation. In other words, maximum frequency of operation is the maximum frequency (minimum time period of clock) that satisfies the following condition:
> **Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup \- Tskew < Tperiod**
> Here,
> **Tck->q = 2 ns, Tprop = 4 ns, Tsetup = 1 ns, Tskew = 1 ns, Tperiod**
> Now,
> **Tperiod** \> 2 ns + 4 ns + 1 ns - 1 ns
> **Tperiod** \> 6 ns
So, the minimum time period of the clock required is 6 ns. And the maximum frequency that the above circuit can work is (1000/6) MHz = 166.67 MHz.
It should be noted that at if we operate this timing path at maximum frequency calculated, setup slack will be zero. :-)
In this post, we talked about frequency of operation of single cycle timing paths. Can you figure out maximum frequency of operation for half cycle timing paths? Also, there is a relation of maximum operating frequency to hold timing? Can you think about this situation?

### 36. Basics of latch timing

**Date:** 2016-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/latch-principle.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/10/latch-principle.html)

### Basics of latch timing
A latch is a digital logic circuit that can sample a 1-bit digital value and hold it depending upon the state of an enable signal. Based upon the state of enable, latches are categorized into positive level-sensitive and negative level-sensitive latches.
**Positive level-sensitive latch**: A positive level-sensitive latch follows the input data signal when enable is '1' and keeps its output when the data when it is '0'. Figure 1 below shows the symbol and the timing waveforms for a latch. As can be seen, whenever enable is '1', out follows the data input. And when enable in '0', out remains the same.
|     |

**Negative level-sensitive latch**: A negative level-sensitive latch follows the input data when enable is '0' and keeps its output when input is '1'.
|     |
| [![In a negative level-sensitive latch, output follows input when enable is '0', otherwise it keeps its previous output state](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1YR8ogfYGBeyqus9e5jwvC1IeQLpkS3tw5JF5jpLRbopyAUvjJ-asbUWWFlwE3TpRpcTNpuAx_X3plEhK0dEMZGMODzpmpZXv6Oe9ooG_LFmZf5Ty5BIOrtLgUSOikUX6fO9v7tyG6FKr/s640/negative+latch.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1YR8ogfYGBeyqus9e5jwvC1IeQLpkS3tw5JF5jpLRbopyAUvjJ-asbUWWFlwE3TpRpcTNpuAx_X3plEhK0dEMZGMODzpmpZXv6Oe9ooG_LFmZf5Ty5BIOrtLgUSOikUX6fO9v7tyG6FKr/s1600/negative+latch.png) |

Latch timing arcs: Data can propagate to the output of the latch in two ways as discussed below:
- **Out changes with Data**: This happens when enable is in its asserted state (for example, for a positive level latch). When this happens, Out follows Data as there is a direct path between Data and Out when Enable is '1'. This scenario is depicted in figures 1(b) and 2(b) above wherein out is shown toggling when Data toggles. The latch is, thus, said to have a timing arc from Data to Out.
- **Out changes with Enable**: This happens when Data at input changes when Enable is in its de-asserted state. When this happens, latch waits for Enable to be asserted, then, follows the value of Data. As figure 3 shows, Data had become stable a lot earlier, but out toggled only when enable became asserted. So, in latches, there exists a timing arc from Enable to Out.

- **Relation between Data and Enable**: If Data toggles very close to the closing edge of Enable, then, there might be a confusion as if its effect will be propagated to output or not (as discussed later in this post). To make things more deterministic, we impose a certain condition that Data should not toggle when Enable is getting de-asserted. This relationship can be modelled as setup and hold arcs. So, there are setup and hold timing arcs between data and enable pins of a latch. These will be discussed below in detail.
**Setup time and hold time for a latch**: The most commonly used latch circuit is that built using inverters and transmission gates. Figure 4 shows the transmission gate implementation of a positive level-sensitive latch. The Enable has been shown as CLK as usually is the case in sequential state machines. This circuit has two phases, as is expected for a latch:
- When CLK = '1', Transmission gate at the input gets ON and there is a direct path between Data and Out
- When CLK = '0', transmission gate in the loopback path gets ON. Out holds its value

| **Figure 4: Positive level-sensitive latch using transmission gates** | |
Now, when CLK transitions from '1' to '0', it is important that Data does not toggle. The time before the clock falling edge that Data should remain stable is known as latch setup time. Similarly, the time after the clock falling edge that Data should remain stable is called latch hold time.
Let us go into the details of what latch setup and hold time should be for transmission gate latch. If we want the data to be propagated properly to the output, then Data should be stable for atleast some time before closing of the input transmission gate. This time is such that it goes into the memory of latch; i.e., before input transmission gate closes, Data should traverse both the inverters of the loop. So, setup time of the latch involves the delay of input transmission gate and the two inverters. Figure 5 below shows the setup time for the latch.

| **Figure 5: Setup time for latch** |
Similarly, if we do not want the data to propagate to output, it must not cross input transmission gate so that it does not disturb the present state of the latch. This server as the hold time for the latch. Assuming CLK' takes one inverter delay, input transmission gate will close after one inverter delay only. So, the hold time for Data is one inverter delay minus transmission gate delay. Please refer to figure 6 below for the illustration of this. (CLK)' is formed from CLK after a delay equivalent to an inverter delay. Only then, input transmission gate will switch off. If we want the data not to propagate to Out, we have to ensure that it does not cross input transmission gate. So, Data should not be present at the transmission gate's input at time (T(inv) - T(tg)). In other words, it has to be held stable this much time after CLK edge. This is the hold time for the latch.

| **Figure 6: Hold time for latch** |
Please note that there are other topologies also possible for latches such as dynamic latches etc. The setup time and hold time calculations for such topologies will vary, but the underlying principle will remain same, which is as follows:
- Setup time ensures that the data propagates to the output at the coming clock edge
- Hold time ensures that the data does not propagate to the output at the present/previous clock edge
**Setup checks and hold checks for latches**: As discussed above, the decision for the data to be latched or not to be latched is made at the closing edge. So, the setup and hold checks are with respect to latch closing edge only. However, since, latches are transparent during half of the clock period, we can assume as if the capturing edge is flexible and stretches all over the active level of the latch. This property enables a very beautiful concept known as "time borrowing" for latches.

Hi
Very good question, yes latches are also prone to metastability similar to flip-flops. You can go through below post to understand the concept.

setup time of the latch involves the delay of input transmission gate and the two inverters. Why is it two inverters . As output of first inverter is output of the latch . Should not it be delay of input transmission gate and one inverter

Hi Praveen
Let us suppose the input transmission gate closes when only the first inverter has toggled its output and has reached pure voltage level (let us say input changed from 0 to 1). Now, both the inverters have 0 as their outputs.
Now, since, the inverter in forward path has more drive strength, the loop will stabilize as desired. Thus, this works as you said. In this case, we can assume that the setup time is equal to delay of transmission gate and 1 inverter.
On the other hand, consider the case when the output of first inverter has just crossed VOL (let us say 0.25 \* VDD) while the output of second inverter is pure 0. Now depending upon the relative strengths of both the inverters, the output can settle at any value between 0 and 1. So, it is not right to say that if 1st inverter output has changed, then the inverter loop will work fine.
O hope I was able to make my point. We can discuss further in case of any queries.

If the clock to the transmission gate is delayed by an inverter then should'nt the input be kept stable for a longer time? That is hold time is transmission gate delay + inverter delay??

Thanks for the useful info .. Can you comment why a latch fanning out to itself creates an issue/warning?

Hi Babul
This is for the same reason we dont allow a combinational gate fanning out to itself.
1\. It can create osillations as inversion can travel from output to input. You can argue that non-inverting paths should be allowed. The same argument is valid for combinational loopback as well. STA tools are not smart enough to handle this.
2\. Tool will have hard time to calculate transition and delay since it will be like a chicken and egg problem
3\. Setup check calculation will be very complex since latch will keep on borrowing time from itself.

### 38. Reset Synchronizer

**Date:** 2016-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/reset-synchronizer.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/reset-synchronizer.html)

### Reset Synchronizer
**Need for reset synchronizer**: The way most of the designs have been modelled needs asynchronous reset assertion and synchronous de-assertion. The requirement of most of the designs these days is:
1. When reset is asserted, it propagates to all designs; brings them to reset state whether or not clock is toggling; i.e. assertion should be asynchronous
2. When reset is deasserted, wait for a clock edge, and then, move the system to next state as per the FSM (Finite State Machine); i.e. deassertion should be synchronous
The top level reset sources are mostly asynchronous, both in assertion and during deassertion. The circuit that manipulates the asynchronous reset to have asynchronous assertion and synchronous deassertion is referred as **reset synchronizer**.
> **Definition of reset synchronizer**: A reset synchronizer synchronizes the deassertion of reset with respect to the clock domain. In other words, a reset synchronizer manipulates the asynchronous reset to have synchronous deassetion.
Figure 1 below shows the schematic representation of how a reset synchronizer is built. It consists of two registers connected in series, the input of first register tied to VDD. The asynchronous reset signal is connected to the **Rbar** pin of both the register. The output of this circuit has synchronized de-assertion. This synchronised reset fans out to the design.
|     |

| **Figure 1: Reset synchronizer** |
**How reset synchronizer works**: When the reset is asserted, it first propagates to reset synchronizer flops. It resets both the flops of reset synchronizer asynchronously (without waiting for clock edge) thereby generating reset assertion for fanout registers. Figure 2 below shows the scenario of reset assertion, and also the timing waveforms associated with assertion of reset.
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJTdNZDMm59Ht_VmxUJ3cvYjUHRTyzT93yk_6NFC9HgaJD9eWCQS7Elp7CdieuWGs2rkt6PGBMn2eRrJz5dVrBvmlPXoNpZdT6GW_8OA4yEH84UfUxtZVEt2UQ3smDpQAlI8z2xsftCUlc/s640/reset_assertion.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJTdNZDMm59Ht_VmxUJ3cvYjUHRTyzT93yk_6NFC9HgaJD9eWCQS7Elp7CdieuWGs2rkt6PGBMn2eRrJz5dVrBvmlPXoNpZdT6GW_8OA4yEH84UfUxtZVEt2UQ3smDpQAlI8z2xsftCUlc/s1600/reset_assertion.png) |
| **Figure 2: Reset assertion** |
Similarly, the de-assertion of reset first reaches the two flops of reset synchronizer. Now, the first flop in chain propagates 1 to intermediate output upon arrival of a clock edge. Upon next clock edge, this signal propagates to the output thereby reaching the fanout registers. The reset de-assertion timing (recovery and removal checks timing) should be met from second stage of reset synchronizer to all the domain registers' reset pins as the deassertion is synchronous.

**Some facts about reset synchronizer**:
1. The reset synchronizer manipulates the originally asynchronous reset to have synchronous deassertion.
2. The reset synchronizer must fanout to all the registers that need to be " **OUT OF RESET**" in a single cycle. And there must be a single synchronizer for all such flops, otherwise, some flops will be out of reset 2 cycles later, some 3 cycles later; thus, defeating the purpose of reset synchronization.
3. There can, of course, be multiple reset synchronizers in the design, with the number equal to number of functional clock domains. Each reset synchronizer fans out to all the resettable flops of its own clock domain.
4. The timing constraints related to a reset synchronizer are discussed [here](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2020/04/timing-requirementsconstraints-related.html).

In Figure 2, how reset assertion combinationally causes the output of the second flop in reset synchronizer to go to zero?

This is the basic property of a flip-flop with asynchronous reset. When reset is asserted, the flop's output goes zero. This is what is happening here. :-)

if reset is asserted (=1) you say the flops output goes to 0. Then in figure 3 is wrong, because the reset = 1 , then is asserted and then flops output goes to 0 right?. In figure 3 the reset shouldn't be 0 all the time ?

Reset assertion means (reset = 0) deassertion is (reset = 1). He is showing an example of active low reset, that is the circuit is driven low when the input is driven low.

The reset signal described in this article is active low, meaning, when reset is asserted, it has a value of 0 and when reset is deasserted, it has a value of 1. So Figure 3 is correct.

Do we need to use inverter at the input of each reset pin of functional domain FF

It depends upon your design architecture actually. Let us suppose the flip-flops we are using are the ones with active low asynchronous reset. If the reset signal coming is also active low, we dont need to. In case the reset signal is active high, then, we need to use inverters. But that inverter will be common for all registers of that domain.

Also it saves ton of energy. Imagine, in a system where reset assertion means giving 1 on reset pin, to put system in reset you have to keep giving 1 in the system. That means even when system is under reset it uses a lot of power. Compared to this, when reset is active low, you just power off the domain and you can have 0 on the reset pin. POWER SAVED!

why do we need two stages here? When reset is de-asserted, we can propagate the reset to the fanouts with 1 clk cycle delay right? May be I am missing something. Can you please clarify?

Hi
Good question. The reason we use two flops is because the reset is asynchronous to the fanout flops. Thus, one stage is needed to absorb the metastability itself.

In Figure 3, for synchronizer flops, reset deassertion should be asynchronous right ? So why does the output change only when clock edge arrives ?

Hi
A reset synchronizer synchronizes the deassertion of reset. That is why, deassertion is shown with respect to clock edge and is now synchronous.

The synchronizer flop outputs change only at clock edges because that is the basic property of a flip-flop. Since reset is deasserted, the regular operation of a flip-flop occurs, which is to capture the value at its input pin on a clock edge (in this case, rising), and have it appear at the output pin.

No, shift is not concerned about the functionality of the flop. A reset synchroniser is simply two flops put together with "d" input of first flop getting a constant value. During shift, they should be treat the same way as normal 2-bit flops.

Hi! during asynchronous deassertion of reset, when the first flop goes into metastability, shouldn't the second flop also go into metastability? as there is a violation of recovery + removal check for both the flops. Or am I missing something?

Hi Anunhav
For the second flop, both input and output are the same value. Hence, it doesn't try to change its state and doesn't go into metastability. I hope that explains. :-)

Hi
Advantage of a reset synchronizer is that it allows you to avoid metastability issues during reset deassertion and also allows cycle certainty for reset deassertion.
The disadvantage is that you have to meet timing from reset synchronizer at the deassertion frequency :-)

### 39. Minimum pulse width

**Date:** 2016-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/min-pulse-width-check.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/min-pulse-width-check.html)

### Minimum pulse width
All the sequential elements need some minimum pulse (either high or low) to ensure that the data has been captured correctly. In other words, clock pulse fed to a flop or latch (or any other sequential element) must be wide enough so that it does not interfere with correct functionality of the element. By correct functionality, is meant, the internal operations of the cell.
**Minimum pulse width requirement**: To understand minimum pulse width requirement, let us first define pulse width. Formally, pulse width can be defined as:
#### "If talking in terms of high signal level (high minimum pulse width), it is the time interval between clock signal crossing half the VDD level during rising edge of clock signal and clock signal crossing half the VDD level during falling edge of clock signal. If talking in terms of low signal level (low minimum pulse width), it is the time interval between clock signal crossing half the VDD level during falling edge of the clock signal and clock signal crossing half the VDD level during rising edge of the clock signal."
If the clock being fed to a sequential object has less pulse width than the minimum required, either of the following is the probable output:
- The flop can capture the correct data and FSM will functional correctly
- The flop can completely miss the clock pulse and does not capture any new data. The FSM will, then, lead to invalid state
- The flop can go meta-stable
All these scenarios are probable of happening; so, it is required to ensure every sequential element always gets a clock pulse greater than minimum pulse width required. To ensure this, there are ways to communicate to timing analysis tool the minimum pulse width requirement for each and every sequential element. The check to ensure minimum pulse width is known as " **minimum pulse width check**". There are following ways to ensure minimum pulse width through minimum pulse width check:
- **Through liberty file**: By default, all the registers in a design should have a minimum pulse width defined through liberty file as this is the format to convey the standard cell requierements to STA tool. By convention, minimum pulse width should be defined for clock and reset pins. Minimum pulse width is constrained in liberty file using following syntax:
                                        Timing type : min\_pulse\_width;
- **Through SDC command**: We can also define minimum pulse width requirement through SDC command. The SDC command for the same is " **set\_min\_pulse\_width**". For example, following set of commands will constrain the minimum pulse width of clock **clk** to be 5 ns high and 4 ns low:
                               set\_min\_pulse\_width -high 5 \[get\_clocks clk\]
                               set\_min\_pulse\_width -low  4 \[get\_clocks clk\]

### 40. Measure time using candle!!

**Date:** 2016-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/measure-time-using-candle.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/measure-time-using-candle.html)

### Measure time using candle!!
**Problem statement**: You have two candles that can be burnt from both sides. Each candle takes exactly one hour to get burnt completely. You have to measure 45 minutes with the help of these candles. How will you do it?
**Solution**: Here, we cannot assume that the candle will burn uniformly. So, we cannot  assume that half the candle will get burnt in half an hour and so on. But, if we can somehow let it burn for half an hour, then we can surely assume that the rest will burn in half hour only.
The solution of this puzzle follows:
First, light one of the candles from both sides. Simultaneously, light the other candle from one side only. Now, the first candle will get exhausted in half an hour only as discussed above. After half hour, the other candle has another half an hour left in it. As soon as first candle gets burnt up completely, light the other end of the second candle. Now, the second candle will get exhausted after another 15 minutes as it will burn at twice the rate.
This is how we can measure 45 minutes using two candles that can be burnt from both the sides.

### 41. Setup checks and hold checks for latch-to-flop timing paths

**Date:** 2016-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/latch-to-reg-setup-hold-checks.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/latch-to-reg-setup-hold-checks.html)

### Setup checks and hold checks for latch-to-flop timing paths
> There can be 4 cases of latch-to-flop timing paths as discussed below:
> **1\. Positive level-sensitive latch to positive edge-triggered register**: Figure 1 below shows a timing path being launched from a positive level-sensitive latch and being captured at a positive edge-triggered register. In this case, setup check will be full cycle with zero-cycle hold check. Time borrowed by previous stage will be subtracted from the present stage.

Hi How positive edge trigger reg to positive latch path is zero cycle. But positive latch to rising flop is full cycle.?
i read latch to reg timing paths and reg to latch timing paths. Can you please explain

Hi
It's simple. Simply treat the time borrowed by previous stage as a variable. :-)

### 42. 16x1 mux using 4x1 muxes

**Date:** 2016-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/16x1-mux-using-4x1-muxes.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/16x1-mux-using-4x1-muxes.html)

### 16x1 mux using 4x1 muxes
**Implementing 16:1 multiplexer with 4:1 multiplexers**: A 16x1 mux can be implemented
using 5 4x1 muxes. 4 of these multiplexers can be used as first stage to mux 4 inputs each with two
least significant bits of select lines (S0 and S1), resulting in 4 intermediate
outputs, which, then can be muxed again using a 4:1 mux. The implementation of
16x1 mux using 4x1 muxes is shown below in figure 1:

| **Figure 1: Implementing 16:1 mux with the help of 4:1 multiplexers** |
The above approach assumes that all the inputs are of same priority as regards timing. Can you think of a solution which involves timing and prioritizes some of the inputs? A hint for you is that the solution will require 5 select lines instead of four.

### 43. Why is body connected to ground for all nmos and not to VDD

**Date:** 2016-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/nmos-bulk-common.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/09/nmos-bulk-common.html)

### Why is body connected to ground for all nmos and not to VDD
To prevent latch-up in CMOS, the body-source and body-drain diodes should not be forward biased; i.e, body terminal should be at same or lesser voltage than source terminal (for an NMOS; for a PMOS, it should be at higher voltage than source). This condition will be satisfied if we connect all the nmos bodies to their respective sources. But we see that all the body terminals are connected to a common ground.
This is due to the reason that all the nmos transistors share a common substrate, and a substrate can only be biased to one voltage. Although it introduces body effect and makes transistors slower and deviate from ideal mos current equation, there is no other way.
One could achieve different body voltage for all nmos transistors by putting all transistors in different wells, but that would mean a tremendous penalty in terms of area as there needs to be minimum size and separation that needs to be maintained which is huge in comparison to transistor sizes. This is the reason why body is connected to ground for all NMOS.
Similarly, body of all PMOS transitors is connected to a common terminal VDD.

### 45. Lockup latches vs. lockup registers: what to choose

**Date:** 2016-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/08/lockup-latches-vs-lockup-flops.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/08/lockup-latches-vs-lockup-flops.html)

### Lockup latches vs. lockup registers: what to choose
Both lockup latches and lockup
registers are used to make scan chain robust to hold failures. What one uses
for the same depends upon his/her priorities and the situation. However, it
seems lockup latches are more prevalent in designs of today. This might be due
to following reasons:
1. **Area**: As we know, a latch occupies only
half the area as a register. So, using lockup latches instead of lockup
registers gives us area and power advantage; i.e., less overhead.
2. **Timing**: [Lockup\\
elements – timing perspective](http://www.design-reuse.com/articles/37956/lockup-elements-the-timing-perspective.html) has given an analysis of how timing critical
lockup elements (lockup latches and lockup registers) paths can be. According to it, using a negative lockup latch,
you don’t have to meet timing at functional (at-speed) frequency. However, in
all other cases, you need to meet timing. This might also be a reason people
prefer lockup latches.
Lockup latches, on one hand relax
only one side hold. So, you can afford to have skew only on one side, either on launch or
on capture. Lockup registers, on the other hand, let you have skew on both the
sides. So, lockup latches are preferable where you can afford to have tap on
the clock either from launch flop or on capture flop. On the other hand, lockup
flops can be used by tapping clock from any point as long as you meet setup and
hold timings.
Hope you’ve found this post useful. Let us know what you think in the comments.

Hi
Wonderful post.
Can you please elaborate on "Lockup latches, on one hand relax only one side hold. So, you can afford to have skew only on one side, either on launch or on capture. Lockup registers, on the other hand, let you have skew on both the sides"
Thanks

If lockup registers are used, is it a problem for LEC? Lockup latch is being added by the synthesis tool (for every domain crossing flop in the scan chain) - so is it possible to tell the tool to add a lockup register instead ?

Different logic equivalence tools may have different interpretations of LEC check in case of lockup registers. But one thing common could be "unreachable si pin" in LEC check. There could be user-interpreted waivers for lockup registers, but usually you can get away with only lockup latches. You should not be needing a lockup register, where you cannot have a corresponding RTL element (the lockup registers usually are terminal lockups, which can be inserted in RTL as well, thus, making LEC easier)

### 46. Quiz: Modeling skew requirements with data-to-data setup and hold checks

**Date:** 2016-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/08/model-skew-with-data-checks.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/08/model-skew-with-data-checks.html)

### Quiz: Modeling skew requirements with data-to-data setup and hold checks
**Problem: Suppose there are 'N' signals which are to be skew matched within a window of 200 ps with respect to each other. Model this requirement with the help of data setup and hold checks.**
As we discussed in [data setup and data hold checks](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2013/07/data-to-data-checks-constraining.html), data setup check of 200 ps means that constrained data should come at least 200 ps before the reference data. Similarly, data hold check of 200 ps constrains the constrained data to come at least 200 ps after the reference data. The same is shown pictorially in figure 1(a) and 1(b).

| **Figure 1(b): Data hold check of 200 ps constrains the constrained signal to toggle at-least 200 ps after the reference signal has toggled.** |
Now, suppose you apply a data setup check of -200 ps instead of 200 ps. This would mean that the constrained signal can toggle upto 200 ps after the reference signal. Similarly, a data hold check of -200 ps would mean that the constrained signal can toggle from 200 ps before the reference signal. If we apply both the checks together, it would infer that constrained signal can toggle in a window that ranges from 200 ps before the toggling of reference signal to 200 ps after the toggling of reference signal. This is pictorially shown in figures 2(a) and 2(b).

| **Figure 2(a): Negative data setup and hold checks of 200 ps** |
If we combine the two checks, it implies that the constrained data can toggle upto 200 ps after and from 200 ps before the reference signal. In other words, we have constrained the constrained signal to toggle in a window +- 200 ps within the reference signal.
Coming to the given problem, if there are a number of signals required to toggle within a window of 200 ps, we can consider one of these to act as reference signal and other signals as constrained signals. The other signals can then be constrained in both setup and hold with respect to reference signal such that all of these lie within +-100 ps of the reference signal. The same is shown in figure 3 below:

Hi,
Just to let you know, I think skew windows created using set\_data\_check -setup and -hold options are mutually exclusive windows, and hence it would be incorrect to say that skew window is setup+hold width wide. To create a skew window of 200ps for N signals, both -setup and -hold options require 0.2 , not 0.1
However, if you want to create "no change window" around an edge or a pulse, then -setup and -hold options, then no change window width is the combined value (setup+hold)
Does that make sense?
Thanks,

Hi
You are right in case there are only two signals. But in the question of concern, there were a number of (let us say 10) signals which have to be maintained within a skew of +-200 ps. So, if we take signal "0" as reference. If signal "1" is -100 ps wrt signal "0" and signal "2" is +100 ps wrt signal "0", then signals "1" & "2" are 200 ps apart. That is how, 200 changed to 100. I hope I make sense.

That's completely wrong analysis. Not sure why would you think that to be correct for 2 signals but not for >2 signals. set\_data\_check skew check commands remains the same irrespective of the number of signals to be skew-checked. Anyways, I am not here to debate over. I would suggest draw waveforms, write a script for skew check, dump out skew check reports from primetime/tempus, and see what's going on. May be you can share the reports if you think you are right. thanks

Hi Amit
Yes, the problem given here is "skew-constrain a few signals with the help of data checks for a skew of 200 ps". There can be two ways of doing this (not writing as per syntax, more in algorithmic form):
1\. for {i = 0} {i < num} {i++} {
for {j = 0} {j < i} {j++} {
if {i != j} {

}
2\. Take a reference signal, for instance signal 0 and constrain each signal with respect to this (the method chosen here). Now, constraining signal 1 and signal 2 with 200 ps with respect to signal\[0\] will mean that signal 1 and signal 2 can have 400 ps skew between themselves. That is why, it has to be made 100 ps.
for {i = 1} {i < num} {i++} {
set\_data\_check -setup 100 -from signal\[0\] -to signal\[i\]
}
You can refer figure 3 for more clarity. This is the drawn waveform as well. :-)

### 47. Time borrowing in latches

**Date:** 2016-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/08/time-borrowing-in-latches.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/08/time-borrowing-in-latches.html)

### Time borrowing in latches
**What is time borrowing**: Latches exhibit the property of being transparent when clock is asserted to a required value. In sequential designs, using latches can enhance performace of the design. This is possible due to time borrowing property of latches. We can define time borrowing in latches as follows:
> Time borrowing is the property of a latch by virtue of which a path ending at a latch can borrow time from the next path in pipeline such that the overall time of the two paths remains the same. The time borrowed by the latch from next stage in pipeline is, then, subtracted from the next path's time.
The time borrowing property of latches is due to the fact that latches are level sensitive; hence, they can capture data over a range of times than at a single time, the entire duration of time over which they are transparent. If they capture data when they are transparent, the same point of time can launch the data for the next stage (of course, there is combinational delay from data pin of latch to output pin of latch).
Let us consider an example wherein a negative latch is placed between two positive edge-triggered registers for simplicity and ease of understanding. The schematic diagram for the same is shown in figure 1 below:
|     |
| [![A latch placed between two registers. Tha path from regA to latch can borrow time from the path between latch and regB](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLjo_E6fBrlUlXOZsDqPPeUcrzmTnhFOXhffbyw8vK71HISYwPKkcEmzYRQfKJ7HWXcoDbwQTzwKevOtwQKQzowkUWYeblOh9ivBZ5aPXBYCMItLie6ijcMB08yTi1x-UGoVWQfJbK-qJP/s640/latch+pipeline.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLjo_E6fBrlUlXOZsDqPPeUcrzmTnhFOXhffbyw8vK71HISYwPKkcEmzYRQfKJ7HWXcoDbwQTzwKevOtwQKQzowkUWYeblOh9ivBZ5aPXBYCMItLie6ijcMB08yTi1x-UGoVWQfJbK-qJP/s1600/latch+pipeline.png) |
| **Figure 1: Negative level-sensitive latch between two positive edge-triggered registers** |
Figure 2 below shows the clock waveform for all the three elements involved. We have labeled the clock edges for convenience. As is shown, latB is transparent during low phase of the clock. RegA and RegC (positive edge-triggered registers) can capture/launch data only at positive edge of clock; i.e., at Edge1, Edge3 or Edge5. LatB, on other hand, can capture and launch data at any instant of time between Edge2 and Edge3 or Edge4 and Edge5.
|     |
| [![Clock waveforms for positive register negative latch positive flip-flop case](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0XOnxW4m3zr-5569L-vG_m89mh2AsZUE1bu4LxYOJPOHXRtuG5_YJX4VN8ov4EfEQkNuaiW222MkLuayBYkJ2TYBVpMApFq-doKGE0b5McGC-HmbbiLWFRWS9_j6Dh0P2SyuDXQD59LFW/s640/clock+waveform.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0XOnxW4m3zr-5569L-vG_m89mh2AsZUE1bu4LxYOJPOHXRtuG5_YJX4VN8ov4EfEQkNuaiW222MkLuayBYkJ2TYBVpMApFq-doKGE0b5McGC-HmbbiLWFRWS9_j6Dh0P2SyuDXQD59LFW/s1600/clock+waveform.png) |
| **Figure 2: Clock waveforms** |
The time instant at which data is launched from LatB depends upon the time at which data launched from RegA has become stable at the input of latB. If the data launched at Edge1 from RegA gets stable before Edge2, it will get captured at Edge2 itself.  However, if the data is not able to get stable, even then, it will get captured. This time, as soon as the data gets stable, it will get captured. The latest instant of time this can happen is the latch closing edge (Edge3 here). One point here to be noted is that at whatever point data launches from LatB, it has to get captured at RegC at edge3. The more time latch takes to capture the data, it gets subtracted from the next path. The worst case setup check at latB is at edge2. However, latch can borrow time as needed. The maximum time borrowed, ideally, can be upto Edge3. Figure 3 below shows the setup and hold checks with and without time borrow for this case:
|     |

| **Figure 3: Setup check with and without time borrow** |
The above example consisted of a negative level-sensitive latch. Similarly, a positive level-sensitive latch will also borrow time from the next stage, just the polarities will be different.

Hi sir,
Can I say that we get required time is 1.5 clock cycle when there is path between positive triggered floo to positive latch..some where in internet they show this is possible.
Is it correct or wrong

Yes If the middle latch is positive enabled, then the total path becomes 2 cycle instead of 1.
Therefore you can borrow uptil 1.5 cycles and next path could become 0.5 cycle

I dont agree with the concepts provided in the link you shared. A positive flop to latch path is half cycle, not 1.5 cycle.

Hi sir,
By default tool has setup check like
Set\_multicycle\_path 1 -end -setup...
So it might possible in this way

Hi
Yes, they seem to have assumed "set\_multicycle\_path 2 -end -setup" for to\_latch timing path because default setup check for pos\_flop -> pos\_latch path is zero cycle without time borrow and half cycle with max time borrow. But they have missed one basic thing of hold, which also moves along setup check, if not taken care by design. But for illustration purposes, their example is good.

Hi,
If you are going to capture the data at edge 3, then putting a latch in between will only add-up extra delay right?. Instead u can combine the combinational logic and give it directly to the reg C. What is the use of negative latch here then?

Hi
Delay will not be same for combinational logic accross all combinations of process, voltage and temperature. For correct state machine behavior, you need to ensure that data is captured always at the same edge as the state machine is designed for. This may not be true for purely data transfer cases, where data is transferred from one module to another. Here also, you need to ensure that there is no metastability. Hence, a latch is needed to ensure predictable delay in cases of PVT where the delay is less. I hope I was able to answer your query.

There is no benefit here in adding negative latch in above example. All it will do is add delay. If data can be captured by latch before edge3 and next flop can capture data from latch at edge 3 then what is the use of latch. Even if you remove that latch , next flop will capture data at edge 3 if it is able to do it with latch.

Hi,
As I see in the standard cells, the setup and hold checks are happening at positive edge of a negative level latch.
So in the above example, the timing check is happening at negative edge for negative level latch.
I am thinking that above two statements are conflicting.
Can you let me know that is anything that I am missing?
Regards
A.Kotaiah

Hi
Yes, you are right that textbooks teach what you are talking about and it is right too when a latch is implemented standalone. But when a latch is implemented in a system, it is convenient to assume it the way that has been mentioned in this post due to the concept of time borrowing only. In case of any queries, please let me know. I'll try to share in more detail.

Hi
I assume you just want to explore the concepts and not implement the design. In that case, you can just replace a flip-flop in gate-level code by a latch.

Sir , If you launching at edge1 and capturing at edge3 , it is totally 1 clock cycle alone. Then what did you even borrow ? Time borrow means , a timing path gets more than 1 clock cycle to compute. for which there needs to be a positive sensitive latch inbetween. this negative latch inbetween will only give "hold protection" to RegC nothing else . Hold protection means, when hold check is performed at RegC , The latch is opaque. so a new data cannot come and corrupt the current sampled data as the latch is behaving like a WAll for half cycle. Thats the only benefit when you have negative latch between 2 flops. For time borrow , you need positive latch between 2 flops....

Hi vn
Setup check from positive flop to positive latch is zero cycle, so there is no advantage of a positive latch here. Here, timing is being borrowed as positive flop to negative latch was half cycle and it can indeed take more than half cycle if there is positive slack in latch to flop path.

So.. Can you please clarify this for me?
1\. We need to use +ve level latch incase we want to solve the set-up time violation
2\. We need to use -ve level latch incase we want to fix hold time issue
Is this correct ?

Hi, no this cannot be generalized. It is the relative position of latches that matters.

Hi,Nice artical. Will pos level sensitive latch to pos level sensitive latch will give setup relaxation more than 1 cycle?

Hi, under normal cases, it is not possible since you have to take care of hold itself. But having said that, you can always modify your state machine, like you do in case of flip-flops and achieve multi-cycle paths.

### 48. 2-input gates using 2:1 mux

**Date:** 2016-08

### 2-input gates using 2:1 mux
**Definition of a multiplexer**: A 2^n-input mux has n select lines. It can be used to implement logic functions by implementing LUT (Look-Up Table) for that function. A 2-input mux can implement any 2-input function, a 4-input mux can implement any 3-input, an 8-input mux can implement any 4-input function, and so on. This property of muxes makes FPGAs implement programmable hardware with the help of LUT muxes. In this post, we will be discussing the implementation of 2-input AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR and XNOR gates using a 2-input mux.
**2-input AND gate implementation using 2:1 mux**: Figure 1 below shows the truth table of a 2-input AND gate. If we observe carefully, OUT equals '0' when A is '0'. And OUT follows B when A is '1'. So, if we connect A to the select pin of a 2:1 mux, AND gate will be implemented if we connect D0 to '0' and D1 to 'B'.

**2-input NAND gate using 2:1 mux**: Figure 3 below shows the truth table of a 2-input NAND gate. If we observe carefully, OUT equals '1' when A is '0'. Similarly, when A is '1', OUT is B'. So, if we connect SEL pin of mux to A, D0 pin of mux to '1' and D1 to B', then it will act as a NAND gate.

2-input OR gate using 2x1 mux: Figure 5 below shows the truth table for a 2-input OR gate. If we observe carefully, OUT equals B when A is '0'. Similarly, OUT is '1' (or A), when A is '1'.

    In 2 input XNOR gate, there is a typo in the below line
    The implementation of 2-input XOR gate using a 2x1 mux is as shown in figure 10
    It should be XNOR instead of XOR.
    Thank you!

### 49. Design Quiz: multiply by 2 clock circuit

**Date:** 2016-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/07/clock-multiply-by-two.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/07/clock-multiply-by-two.html)

### Design Quiz: multiply by 2 clock circuit
**Design problem: Make a simple circuit whose output clock is twice in**
**frequency to the input clock.**
An XOR gate with
one of its input getting delayed version of the other input can act as a
frequency multiplier. Since, an XOR gate produces a ‘0’ when both inputs are
same, and ‘1’ when both inputs are different; if it gets delayed version of one
input at the other, every time input toggles, a pulse is produced at the
output. The duration of the pulse is equal to the delay introduced by delay
element. The circuit and the resulting waveform is shown in figure 1 below. This
circuit arrangement is also known as **pulse generator** as it produces a pulse on
every toggle of input.
|     |
| [![An XOR pulse generator circuit can act as a multiply by two, but it does not guarantee a duty cycle](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhT4aH8IwQT_8UmhG0Zme5nSBUxo5YQSrkz9w1q9uFzDLO5d98JCsg4T81VABErizjGE1OAqxUxiqEbS-dP9Bgx7MfY4BoZdq5dvqcvhmtlvtKBdFSoeMpndnKjtp_0TUPVGr2uwbMgcYJn/s640/multiply+by+2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhT4aH8IwQT_8UmhG0Zme5nSBUxo5YQSrkz9w1q9uFzDLO5d98JCsg4T81VABErizjGE1OAqxUxiqEbS-dP9Bgx7MfY4BoZdq5dvqcvhmtlvtKBdFSoeMpndnKjtp_0TUPVGr2uwbMgcYJn/s1600/multiply+by+2.png) |

**Characteristics of XOR multiply by 2**:
- The output pulse duration is equal to the delay
introduced by delay element.
- For duty cycle to be equal to 50%, the delay
element’s delay must be half that of input clock. Since, this cannot be
guaranteed, the output duty cycle will not be 50%.
- The delay element’s delay must be less than half
the input clock period; otherwise it will not work
- The inactive state of XOR multiply-by-2 will be 0 as it produces a '0' when both inputs are same. To implement a multiply-by-2 circuit with '1' as inactive state, you will have to use an XNOR gate.

Is there any way to generate clock multiply by 4 using similar circuit apart from PLL?

Hi
Good question, one of the ways is, of course, cascade two multiply-by-two circuits, satisfying the condition "The delay element’s delay must be less than half the input clock period; otherwise it will not work". But this will not work for all frequencies and will have a lot of limitations. The best way for frequency multiplication is to use PLL as far as I know.

### 50. Multiplexer

**Date:** 2016-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/07/multiplexer.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/07/multiplexer.html)

### Multiplexer
**Definition of mux**: A multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects one
out of multiple input signals depending upon the state of select line. A 2^N:1 multiplexer with ‘ **N**’ select lines can select 1 out of 2^N inputs. In other words, the multiplexer connects the output to one of its inputs based upon the value held at the select lines. A multiplexer (or commonly called as MUX) is also termed as data selector. Common functions of a multiplexer include concentrating the multiple data lines onto one single line. It can also be used as a data selector or clock selector.
Multiplexers can be categorized based upon the number of inputs:
- **2-input mux**: A 2:1 mux has 2 data input lines and 1 select line. The state of select line decides which of the inputs propagates to the output. The truth table of 2x1 mux is given below. As it shows, when SEL is 1, OUT follows IN2 and when SEL is 0, OUT follows IN1.

The truth table for 3-input mux is given below. As can be seen, for SEL value "10" and "11", IN2 is selected at the output (this is one of the 3 possible scenarios, repetition of IN0 or IN1 is also possible).

### 51. Multicycle paths handling in STA

**Date:** 2016-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/07/multicycle-path-sta.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/07/multicycle-path-sta.html)

### Multicycle paths handling in STA
In the post [Multicycle paths - the architectural perspective](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2014/07/multicycle-paths-sta.html), we discussed about the architectural aspects of multicycle paths. In this post, we will discuss how multicycle paths are handling in backend optimization and timing analysis:
**How multi-cycle paths are handled in STA**: By default, in STA, all the timing paths are considered to have default setup and hold timings; i.e., all the timing paths should be covered in either half cycle or single cycle depending upon the nature of path (see [setup-hold checks part 1](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2013/07/setup-and-hold-checks-static-timing.html) and [setup-hold checks part 2](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2013/08/setup-and-hold-checks-part-ii-static.html) for reference). However, it is possible to convey the information to STA engine regarding a path being multi-cycle. There is an  SDC command "set\_multicycle\_path" for the same. Let us elaborate it with the help of an example:
|     |
| [![Path from ff1 to ff2 is a multicycle path](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBu7XVK04HZY5eBLipV4AkfAxIfQrTdioPPRoDTYE2VQ29KIzX-EAWg-81P7onJo5J-JqgBPrrXu41iAxhaDe5Vb-iUYzQhafs8ZoB4uOyWCDRnEoQHQo7S0Mbdr6Hsj9PjxSOSf1aCTgL/s400/multicycle+path.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBu7XVK04HZY5eBLipV4AkfAxIfQrTdioPPRoDTYE2VQ29KIzX-EAWg-81P7onJo5J-JqgBPrrXu41iAxhaDe5Vb-iUYzQhafs8ZoB4uOyWCDRnEoQHQo7S0Mbdr6Hsj9PjxSOSf1aCTgL/s1600/multicycle+path.png) |
| **Figure 3: Path from ff1/Q to ff2/D is multicycle path** |
Let us assume a multi-cycle timing path (remember, it has to be ensured by architecture) wherein both launch and capture flops are positive edge-triggered as shown in figure 3.  The default setup and hold checks for this path will be as shown in red in figure 4. We can tell STA engine to time this path in 3 cycles instead of default one cycle with the help of **set\_multicycle\_path** SDC command:
**set\_multicycle\_path 3 -setup -from ff1/Q -to ff2/D**
Above command will shift both setup and hold checks forward by two cycles. That is, setup check will now become 3 cycle check and hold will be 2 cycle check as shown in blue in figure 4. This is because, by default, STA engine considers hold check one active edge prior to setup check, which, in this case, is after 3 cycles.
|     |
| [![When you apply multicycle path only for setup, hold also moves along as default hold check is one edge prior to setup check](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgu2wdVDB-wwqPk5sA1BY1trg5ngd5bQkhY_QdQQ_EOUDVY6UGvrsYuXTmuYiyW026eqI4D_vbYSIip-IauGmRrSVFH5pycc1N3XZkeBlOK_oC2MvnVSOSfTTBGvjwtR1MhBenz85gO08D8/s640/mcp1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgu2wdVDB-wwqPk5sA1BY1trg5ngd5bQkhY_QdQQ_EOUDVY6UGvrsYuXTmuYiyW026eqI4D_vbYSIip-IauGmRrSVFH5pycc1N3XZkeBlOK_oC2MvnVSOSfTTBGvjwtR1MhBenz85gO08D8/s1600/mcp1.png) |
| **Figure 4: Setup and hold checks before and after applying multicyle for setup-only** |
However, this is not the desired scenario in most of the cases. As we discussed earlier, multi-cycle paths are achieved by either gating the clock path or data path for required number of cycles. So, the required hold check in most cases is 0 cycle. This is done through same command with switch "-hold" telling the STA engine to pull hold back to zero cycle check.
**set\_multicycle\_path -hold 2 -from ff1/Q -to ff2/D**
The above command will bring back the hold check 2 cycles back to zero cycle. This is as shown in figure 5 in blue.
|     |
| [![On applying multicycle path for hold, hold check comes back to where it was intended. It does not impact setup check](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcvpe7gW-8pnCpw9gX2-kvqAxWBXOlH-fcMfY26Gj8XLXCPGjgAvHIc4_L1jx8XCsUuVB2tJ0No491cD-_QyKtPvp-qWWxAdAK-2TUB3iRT09n0Sfxxv4LAUAtCLFBrW2-gZ02YbYytlBD/s640/mcp2.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcvpe7gW-8pnCpw9gX2-kvqAxWBXOlH-fcMfY26Gj8XLXCPGjgAvHIc4_L1jx8XCsUuVB2tJ0No491cD-_QyKtPvp-qWWxAdAK-2TUB3iRT09n0Sfxxv4LAUAtCLFBrW2-gZ02YbYytlBD/s1600/mcp2.png) |
| **Figure 5: Setup and hold checks after applying multi-cycle exceptions for both setup and hold** |
We need to keep in mind the following statement:
**Setting a multi-cycle path for setup affects the hold check by same number of cycles as setup check in the same direction. However, applying a multi-cycle path for hold check does not affect setup check.**
So, in the above example, both the statements combined will give the desired setup and hold checks. Please note that there might be a case where only setup or hold multi-cycle is sufficient, but that is the need of the design and depends on how FSM has been modeled.
**What if both clock periods are not equal**: In the above example, for simplicity, we assumed that launch and capture clock periods are equal. However, this may not be true always. As discussed in [multicycle path - the architectural perspective](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2014/07/multicycle-paths-sta.html), it makes more sense to have multi-cycle paths where there is a difference in clock periods. The setup and hold checks for multicycle paths is not as simple in this case as it was when we considered both the clocks to be of same frequency. Let us consider a case where launch clock period is twice the capture clock period as shown in figure 6 below.
|     |
| [![Setup and hold cheks in case of multicycle paths  for clocks differing in frequencies](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhakPE5tj2KY_XP1UjhUUJ3rsevuWyEHslo2YDwX6r9CxCI2Zc0UFvfqs5X4z5bQKEjQB-L8-lHi_zxU6vBv79jtvDx432bbrmr3LcYsP2vPspDspHueka3mjaEfWrDsUc7Haj3bY9GWoHi/s640/mcp3.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhakPE5tj2KY_XP1UjhUUJ3rsevuWyEHslo2YDwX6r9CxCI2Zc0UFvfqs5X4z5bQKEjQB-L8-lHi_zxU6vBv79jtvDx432bbrmr3LcYsP2vPspDspHueka3mjaEfWrDsUc7Haj3bY9GWoHi/s1600/mcp3.png) |
| **Figure 6: Default setup and hold checks for case where capture clock period is half that of launch clock** |
Now, the question is, defining a multi-cycle path, what clock period will be added to the setup check, launch or capture? The answer depends upon the architecture and FSM of the design. Once you know it, the same can be modelled in timing constraints. There is a switch in the SDC command to provide for which of the clock periods is to be added. "set\_multicycle\_path -start" means that the path is a multi-cycle for that many cycles of launch clock. Similarly, "set\_multicycle\_path -end" means that the path is a multicycle for that many cycles of capture clock. Let the above given path be a multicycle of 2. Let us see below how it changes with -start and -end options.
      1. set\_multicycle\_path -start: This will cause a cycle of launch clock to be added in setup check. As expected, on applying a hold multicycle path of 1, the hold will return back to 0 cycle check. Figure 7 below shows the effect of below two commands on setup and hold checks. As is shown, setup check gets relaxed by one launch clock cycle.
**set\_multicycle\_path 2 -setup -from ff1/Q -to ff2/D -start**
**set\_multicycle\_path 1 -hold   -from ff1/Q -to ff2/D -start**

| **Figure 8: Setup and hold checks with -start option provided with set\_multicycle\_path** |
       2. **set\_multicycle\_path -end**: This will cause a cycle of capture clock to be added in setup check. As expected, on applying a hold multicycle path of 1, the hold will return back to 0 cycle check. Figure 8 below shows the effect of below two commands on setup and hold checks. As is shown, setup gets relaxed by one cycle of capture clock.
**set\_multicycle\_path 2 -setup -from ff1/Q -to ff2/D -end**
**set\_multicycle\_path 1 -hold   -from ff1/Q -to ff2/D -end**
|     |

| **Figure 9: Setup and hold checks with -end option provided with set\_multicycle\_path** |
**Why is it important to apply multi-cycle paths**: To achieve optimum area, power and timing, all the timing paths must be timed at the desired frequencies. Optimization engine will know about a path being multicycle only when it is told through SDC commands in timing constraints. If we dont specify a multicycle path as multicycle, optimization engine will consider it as a single cycle path and will try to use bigger drive strength cells to meet timing. This will result in more area and power; hence, more cost. So, all multicycle paths must be correctly specified as multicycle paths during timing optimization and timing analysis.

Hello,
If I get the SDC syntax right, there might be a typo in the command that is supposed to 'bring back the hold check 2 cycles back to zero cycle \[..\] as shown in Figure 5 in blue':
set\_multicycle\_path -hold 2 -from ff1/Q -to ff2/D
I think it should rather be:
set\_multicycle\_path -hold 1 -from ff1/Q -to ff2/D
Please disregard my comment if I got the syntax wrong :)
And thank you so much for all the invaluable material you shared through this site!
Ciao,
Paolo

Hi Paolo
No, the figure is relaxing hold check by 2 cycles, so hold multicycle should be 2 cycles only. And thanks for appreciation.

I think,
at figure 8, blue line for set\_muliticycle\_path 2 -setup ..-start
not correct
   -\> It means,2 cycle in term of start clock
blue line only 1,5 cycle of start clock

Hi
"set\_multicycle\_path n -setup" means that you get "n-1" cycle extra than default setup check.

I agree with Hung. This multicycle here doesn't makes sense to me as well. What we are saying effectively that every 1.5 Cycle launch clock will send data. But launch clock can send data either every clock cycle or every 2 clock cycle. If it sends data every cycle then capture clock wont be able to take that data at that pace & there will be data loss. If the launch clock sends data every 2 cycle, then the MCP should be worst 2 cycle of launch clock.
In my view, when we apply MCP between slow & fast clock, the MCP is always applied wrt the faster clock. Please let me know if I am missing something.

yes, but what you have drawn is 1.5 extra cycles instead of 2. Look at the start clock, you've drawn the blue line to the negative edge, making it 1.5 cycles instead of the 2.

Hi
Multicycle path of "n" means (n-1) cycles extra than default setup check. In this case, default setup check was 0.5 cycles; hence, MCP of 2 is 1.5 cycles of the clock with higher period.

I guess I missed that the default is always based on the capture clock. Thanks.

I am wondering what the waveforms would be looked like for fig8 and fig9 if multicycle for setup are 3, for hold are 2.

What is the meaning if we give set\_multicycle\_path -setup 3 -from \[get\_pins {ff1/q}\]

It will mean that all the timing paths starting from ff1/q will get 2 extra cycles with respect to start clock. However, i see a basic issue in this statement, most of the tools will allow only "-through ff1/q", since flop/q pin is not a timing startpoint.

### 53. VHDL code for clock divider

**Date:** 2016-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/07/configurable-divider-vhdl.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/07/configurable-divider-vhdl.html)

### VHDL code for clock divider
A clock divider is used to get a divided version of a clock. Clock dividers are a very important component of digital design, and are used ubiquitously.
**VHDL code for a configurable clock divider**: Following is the VHDL code for a
configurable divider. It can divide by any number with 50% duty cycle. It makes
use of a dual edge-triggered decrement counter, with configurable
load; thereby enabling it to divide by any number.
Following is the entity and architecture definitions of top module for clock divider. It takes generic parameter **max\_bits**, which puts a limit on the maximum division that can be obtained with the help of this divider. It takes the **divide\_value** as input, the division ratio of output clock with respect to input clock. The output clock is a divided version of input clock depending on the value of **divide\_value**. We have instantiated a component **decr\_counter**, which takes a parameter and counts downto 0 as discussed in further detail below.
**\-\- This module is for a**
**configurable divider that takes value from a counter and toggles the output**
**clock whenever it receives all zero count.**
library IEEE;
use IEEE.std\_logic\_1164.all;

    GENERIC (
        MAX\_BITS : INTEGER := 10

       );
END ARCHITECTURE behavioral;
Given below is the entity and architecture definition of decr\_counter module. It keeps on decrementing until it reaches value 0. On reaching zero, it loads itself with a pre-determined value that is provided as an input to the counter from its top module.
**\-\- This is the VHDL code for**
**a configurable dual edge-triggered decrement counter.**

0)
         );
END ENTITY;
ARCHITECTURE behavioral OF configurable\_decr\_counter

            IF count\_value = 1 THEN
                count\_value <=
to\_StdLogicVector(load\_count);
            ELSE
                count\_value <= count\_value -

            END IF;
            count <=

        END IF;
    END PROCESS;
END ARCHITECTURE behavioral;
**By the way, this code is not synthesizable, although it will simulate perfectly. We have to make a simple modification to the code to make it synthesizable.

### 54. Bubble errors and bubble error correction

**Date:** 2016-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/07/bubble-error-correction.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/07/bubble-error-correction.html)

### Bubble errors and bubble error correction
Bubble
error correction is a very common term associated to flash ADCs ( [see\\
flash ADC block diagram](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2013/07/analog-to-digital-converter.html)) wherein the output produced by comparators stage
is expected to be a thermometer code. However, due to multiple non-idealities
and mismatches in comparators and their inputs, the output may not be a symbol
of thermometer code, but has some irregularities. So, the thermometer to binary
converter stage may not be able to convert it to binary code as it is generally
a state machine that accepts only thermometer code as input and may produce a
garbage output if provided some other input that is not thermometer code. There
may be some zeroes in-between a series of ones. For example, the output may be
“01011111” instead of “01111111”. “01011111”, when fed to thermometer to binary
converter will produce garbage value. Either “01111111” should be given or
“00111111” or “00011111”. This will reduce the error. The presence of zeroes in
a series of ones or presence of ones in a series of zeroes in the comparators’
output is termed as bubble error. And the removal of these bubbles from
near-thermometer code is termed as bubble error correction.
**Kinds of bubble errors**: Bubble
errors are categorized by their order. A first order bubble error means there
is only single ‘1’ between a series of zeroes or vice-versa. For example,
“0010001101” has two first order bubbler, on second bit from right and third
bit from left. Similarly, “01100001111” has a second order bubble.
“00011100000000010111” has one third-order and one first-order bubble.
**What circuit can be used to correct**
**bubble errors**? The simplest circuit that can be used to correct bubble
errors is majority-of-three circuit. In it, each output is compared with one
output on the left and one on the right. The majority of the three is finally
produced at the output. This is how a near-thermometer code will be converted
to a thermometer code. However, a majority of three circuit will be able to
correct bubble errors of first order only. There are more sophisticated
circuits for second and higher order bubble correction.

### Delay line based Time to digital converter
A time to
digital converter is a circuit that digitizes time; i.e., it converts time into
digital number. In other words, a time-to-digital converter measures the time
interval between two events and represents that interval in the form of a
digital number.
TDCs are used in places where the
time interval between two events needs to be determined. These two events may,
for example, be represented by rising edges of two signals. Some applications
of TDCs include time-of-flight measurement circuits and All-Digital PLLs.
**Delay line based time-to-digital**
**converter**: This is a very primitive TDC and involves a delay-line which
is used to delay the reference signal. The other signal is used to sample the
state of delay chain. Each stage of delay chain outputs to a flip-flop or a
latch which is clocked by the sample signal. Thus, the output of the TDC forms
a thermometer code as the stage will show a ‘1’ if the reference signal has
passed it, otherwise it will show a zero. The schematic diagram of delay line
based time-to-digital converter is shown in figure 1 below:

### 57. Integer to string conversion and vice-versa in c++

**Date:** 2016-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/06/integer-to-string-conversion-and-vice.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/06/integer-to-string-conversion-and-vice.html)

### Integer to string conversion and vice-versa in c++
While programming, we often need to convert an integer into string and vice-versa. Some of the examples scenarios to do so are as follows:
- One may want to concatenate a string and integer number
- Read input from a file that contains multiple integers and report the sum.
There are multiple ways to do it. C provides inbuilt functions **stoi** (read as string to integer) and **sprintf** to do this task. C++ provides an object-oriented approach for the same. It provides better methods to do it via **sstream** library.
**Concatenation of a string and an integer**: The following piece of code concatenates a string and an integer and returns the result as a string. It first declares an object of class **stringstream** and simply reads in a number into the object. There is nothing special that we need to do for the same.
> **#include <sstream>**
>
> **#include <string>**
>
> **#include <iostream>**
>
> **using namespace std;**
>
> **string concatenate(const string &str,int num) {**
>
> **stringstream s; // stringstream class is defined in sstream**
>
> **s<<num;      //integer num is assigned to string s**
>
> **string ret = str + s.str(); // s.str() return string object from s**
>
> **return ret;**
>
> **}**
**String to integer conversion**: Following piece of code (function) takes two strings as input, converts them into integers by assigning to objects of istringstream type, and returns their sum.
> **int sum(const string &str1,const string &str2) {    istringstream s1(str1); // istringstream is defined in sstream    istringstream s2(str2);    int in1,in2;    s1>>in1;    s2>>in2;    return in1+in2;}**
The following piece of code calls the above two functions to perform concatenation and calculations:
> **int main() {   cout << concatenate("my birthday is on this month of ", 25)<<endl;   cout<<"sum = "<<sum("1","2")<<endl;   cout << concatenate("sum is ",sum("1","2") );}**

### 58. Thermometer code

**Date:** 2016-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/06/binary-to-thermometer-encoder.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/06/binary-to-thermometer-encoder.html)

### Thermometer code
**What is thermometer code**: Thermometer code
resembles the output produced by a thermometer. In thermometer code, a
value representing number ‘N’ has the lowermost ‘N’ bits as ‘1’; others as 0.
So, to move from N to ‘N+1’, just change the rightmost ‘0’ to ‘1’. Figure 1 below
shows graphically the thermometer codes for values from ‘0’ to ‘7’. As is
evident, each value resembles a reading in thermometer. This is how, thermometer
code got its name. Flash ADCs, time-to-digital converters (TDC) are some of
the circuits that utilize thermometer code.
|     |
| [![A thermometer code is a series of zeroes followed by a series of ones. A 8-symbol thermometer code will have 7 bits that need to represent all symbols.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-mrIJbLoxW62tG_nUuzjpE0mx2BmEGa93O6q_F-VaydIp58YBqeN0zNpDostdN3F4K2qKFilo87izWUV4eq7C1pQgcSWY9lpxg-YshhKIdWvfS5EUZiEhAB8alN2zikhW5TOwp8rmJOdG/s640/3+bit+thermometer+code.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-mrIJbLoxW62tG_nUuzjpE0mx2BmEGa93O6q_F-VaydIp58YBqeN0zNpDostdN3F4K2qKFilo87izWUV4eq7C1pQgcSWY9lpxg-YshhKIdWvfS5EUZiEhAB8alN2zikhW5TOwp8rmJOdG/s1600/3+bit+thermometer+code.png) |
| **Thermometer code with 7 symbols** |
**Characteristics of thermometer code**:
- Each symbol in thermometer code is a sequence of
0s followed by a sequence of 1s
- There cannot be 0s in-between two 1s. For example,
a symbol 01011 is invalid in thermometer code
- For an n-bit binary code, the corresponding
thermometer code will have 2n – 1 symbols; hence, as many bits will
be needed to represent thermometer code for the same.
**How to convert from binary to thermometer code**: Given below is
the VHDL code for a 3-bit binary to thermometer converter. A simple case
statement can be utilized for the same.
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD\_LOGIC\_1164.ALL;
use ieee.numeric\_std.all;
entity bin2therm2bit is
                port (
                                binary\_input
: in std\_logic\_vector (1 downto 0);
                                therm\_output
: out std\_logic\_vector (6 downto 0)
                );
end bin2therm6bit;
architecture Behavioral of bin2therm6bit is
begin
                process
(binary\_input)
                begin
                                label1
: case binary\_input is
                                                when
"000" => therm\_output <= "0000000";
                                                when
"001" => therm\_output <= "0000001";
                                                when
"010" => therm\_output <= "0000011";
                                                when
"011" => therm\_output <= "0000111";
                                                when
"100" => therm\_output <= "0001111";
                                                when
"101" => therm\_output <= "0011111";
                                                when
"110" => therm\_output <= "0111111";
                                                when
"111" => therm\_output <= "1111111";
                                                when
others => therm\_output <= “xxxxxxx”;
                                end
case;
                end process;
end Behavioral;

### 59. Virtual clock - purpose and timing

**Date:** 2016-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/06/virtual-clock.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/06/virtual-clock.html)

### Virtual clock - purpose and timing
**What is a virtual clock**: By definition, a
virtual clock is a clock without any source. Stating more clearly, a virtual
clock is a clock that has been defined, but has not been associated with any
pin/port. A virtual clock is used as a reference to constrain the interface
pins by relating the arrivals at input/output ports with respect to it with the
help of input and output delays.
**How to define a**
**virtual clock**: The most simple sdc command syntax to define a virtual clock is
as follows:
**create\_clock –name VCLK –period**
**10**
The above SDC command will define a virtual clock “VCLK” with period 10 ns.
**Purpose of defining a virtual clock**:
The advantage of defining a virtual clock is that we can specify desired
latency for virtual clock. As mentioned above, virtual clock is used to time
interface paths. Figure 1 shows a scenario where it helps to define a virtual
clock. Reg-A is flop inside block that is sending data through PORT outside the
block. Since, it is a synchronous signal, we can assume it to be captured by a
flop (Reg-B) sitting outside the block. Now, within the block, the path to PORT
can be timed by specifying output delay for this port with a clock synchronous
to clock\_in. We can specify a delay with respect to clock\_in itself, but there
lies the difficulty of specifying the clock latency. If we specify the latency
for clock\_in, it will be applied to Reg-A also. Applying output delay with
respect to a real clock causes input ports to get relaxed and output ports to
get tightened after clock tree has been built. Let us elaborate it in some detail below. Let us assume clock period to be 10 ns and the budget allocated to be 3 ns inside; thus, having a "set\_output\_delay" of 7 ns.

We can specify a delay with respect to clock_in itself, but there lies the difficulty of specifying the clock latency. If we specify the latency for clock_in, it will be applied to Reg-A also. Applying output delay with respect to a real clock causes input ports to get relaxed and output ports to get tightened after clock tree has been built.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilPLz1EV77HecEsq6taX9S4WEoq1jXeLz-kd4hT-QNx4Dn4Gb7VNsI5gAm7wyjcyzYi27f-DDf80QKGVBkzHkJpWLr-B_ZrMEtL7dJMpUBYvON9ssRiWNPfPo-Cocti8vICr340OndyQfe/s640/virtual_clock.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilPLz1EV77HecEsq6taX9S4WEoq1jXeLz-kd4hT-QNx4Dn4Gb7VNsI5gAm7wyjcyzYi27f-DDf80QKGVBkzHkJpWLr-B_ZrMEtL7dJMpUBYvON9ssRiWNPfPo-Cocti8vICr340OndyQfe/s1600/virtual_clock.png) |
| **Figure 1: Figure to illustrate virtual clock** |
**Case 1**: Applying "set\_output\_delay" with respect to real clock (R\_CLK)
> **Pre-CTS scenario**: Here, if we apply any latency to the clock, it will be applied both to launch as well as capture registers (capture register is imaginary here). So, we unltimately get a full cycle to time the path. In other words, applying or not applying a latency to the clock will time the path as needed.
> **Post-CTS scenario**: Post-CTS, we need to "set\_propagate\_clock RCLK" in order for clock latencies to come into effect. Doing so, the launch register's actual clock latency will come into picture. However, since, capture register is imaginary, there is no clock built onto it and its latency will be zero. So, we get (clock\_period - RCLK\_latency) as the actual phase shift to time the path. Thus, timing path gets tightened by "RCLK\_latency".
**Case 2**:  Applying set\_output\_delay with respect to virtual clock (VCLK)
> **Pre-CTS scenario**: In this case, in order to provide full cycle for the path to be timed; if we have applied any latency to RCLK, we will have to apply the same latency for VCLK as well.
> **Post-CTS scenario**: After CTS is built and clocks are propagated, network latency of RCLK will be overridden by actual latency. But VCLK will not be propagated and its source + network latencies will still be reflected as applied in constraints. If (VCLK\_source\_latency + VCLK\_network\_latency\_user) is equal to (RCLK\_source\_latency + RCLK\_network\_latency\_CTS), we will still see the same timing path as we see pre-CTS.
Thus, the solution to
the problem is to define a virtual clock and apply output delay with respect to
it. Making the source latency of virtual clock equal to network latency of real
clock will solve the problem.
Can you think of any other method that can serve the purpose of a virtual clock?

Applying output delay with respect to a real clock causes input ports to get relaxed and output ports to get tightened after clock tree has been built. (c)
Could you please explain why?

source latency is from origin of clk to definition point and network latency is from definition point to reg clock pin , then how it became equal in this concept ??

Hi
It does not become equal by itself. We have to make these equal in case we want to see same timing pre-clock\_tree and post-clock\_tree. :-) There is an "if" at the start of the line.

If PreCTS we don't apply any latency to both of them, in PostCTS we can apply what is called "clock network delay (propagated)" in PT (i.e. network+source latency) of real clock as source latency of virtual clock.
What about uncertainty if we apply it to real clock and not to virtual?

Hi
We need to understand what the uncertainty is for. The most common purpose of uncertainty is stage-based margins. If we dont apply uncertainty for virtual clocks, then we assume that we dont need stage margins for timing paths being formed with respect to virtual clocks, which is actually not true. So, we should be applying uncertainty wrt virtual clocks as well; however the magnitude of uncertainty should be lesser as there are less number of elements in IO paths than reg2reg paths.

In postCTS stage I applied the source latency on Virtual clock = to the "clock network delay propagated" and now the OUTPUT delays are ok. Do U think the same must be done for input delay?
I mean to apply source latency on Virtual clock = to clock network delay propagated of real clock?

Yes, but virtual clock is common for output delays as well as input delays. So, I think you have already done this. If you dont apply source latency of virtual clock, output timing becomes tight at block level and input timing becomes relaxed. Thus, timing paths from input ports will become underoptimized due to area and power recovery. This will, then, pose an issue once you plug-in your block with top which will see the timing paths through input ports of the block violating due to incorrect modeling at block level.

If reg2out is violated and in2reg isn't violated. so, when I apply to both input and output port => reg2out violation will be solved, but in2reg will be violated. Is my setting right?

it means that you will need to reduce delays for either input or output ports. For any latency you set, the sum of slacks of input ports & output ports should be greater than 0.

### 60. Interesting problem – Latches in series

**Date:** 2016-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/06/latches-in-series.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/06/latches-in-series.html)

### Interesting problem – Latches in series
**Problem: 100 latches (either all**
**positive or all negative) are placed in series (figure 1). How many cycles of latency will**
**it introduce?**
|     |
| [![This figure shows 100 negative level-sensitive latches connected together in a chain](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHEaAKh6bXNan6I4oaS7ymQU2K3PXqRtDFG-SGviymqPJwJj0p-z60jDa0-Y9uwnWp0psaT-jMqOS7ZImEopcAt0YgQ5RuHpDTfS5iHBFNiVFYaBDmod_SeWzM7zcNyPcmpaY1y1qGNDpy/s640/100+negative+latches+in+series.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHEaAKh6bXNan6I4oaS7ymQU2K3PXqRtDFG-SGviymqPJwJj0p-z60jDa0-Y9uwnWp0psaT-jMqOS7ZImEopcAt0YgQ5RuHpDTfS5iHBFNiVFYaBDmod_SeWzM7zcNyPcmpaY1y1qGNDpy/s1600/100+negative+latches+in+series.png) |
| **Figure 1 : 100 negative level-sensitive latches in series** |
As we know, setup check between latches of same polarity (both positive or negative) is zero cycle with half cycle of time borrow allowed as shown in figure 2 below for negative level-sensitive latches:
|     |
| [![Setup check between two latches of same polarity is zero cycle with half cycle of time borrow allowed.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2d47308KHtWZiLZESl1t9FrJH9JQxycdpag_xJWZvooqf9MzEe6jHuuTMlDjkNcMpPaw6Qdz6XG-iG4eqo9LhNSkAFXGyE1UR8gJIh9_PLFzAllZjELUeB9lXoY8d2BOOg3MFImr2fuEo/s640/latch+setup+check.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2d47308KHtWZiLZESl1t9FrJH9JQxycdpag_xJWZvooqf9MzEe6jHuuTMlDjkNcMpPaw6Qdz6XG-iG4eqo9LhNSkAFXGyE1UR8gJIh9_PLFzAllZjELUeB9lXoY8d2BOOg3MFImr2fuEo/s1600/latch+setup+check.png) |
| **Figure 2: Setup check between two negative level-sensitive latches** |
So, if there are
a number of same polarity latches, all will form zero cycle setup check with
the next latch; resulting in overall zero cycle phase shift.
As is shown in
figure 3, all the latches in series are borrowing time, but allowing any actual
phase shift to happen. If we have a design with all latches, there cannot be a
next state calculation if all the latches are either positive level-sensitive
or negative level-sensitive. In other words, for state-machine implementation,
there should not be latches of same polarity in series.

Can you elaborate this concept further as it is somewhat vague to understand this line " with half cycle of time borrow allowed as shown in figure 2 "

### 62. XOR/XNOR gate using 2:1 MUX

**Date:** 2016-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/05/xor-gate-using-mux.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/05/xor-gate-using-mux.html)

### XOR/XNOR gate using 2:1 MUX
**2-input XOR gate using a 2:1 multiplexer**: As we know, a 2:1
multiplexer selects between two inputs depending upon the value of its select
input. The function of a 2:1 multiplexer can be given as:
**OUT = IN0 when SEL = 0 ELSE IN1**
Also, a 2-input XOR
gate produces a ‘1’ at the output if both the inputs have different value; and ‘0’
if the inputs are same. The truth table of an XOR gate is given as:
|     |     |     |
| A | B | OUT |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
Truth
table of XOR gate
In the truth table of XOR gate, if
we fix a value, say B, then
**OUT = A WHEN B = 0 ELSE A’**
Both the above
equations seem equivalent if we connect negative of IN0 to IN1 in a
multiplexer. This is how a 2:1 multiplexer will implement an XOR gate. Figure 1
below shows the implement of a 2-input XOR gate using a 2:1 Multiplexer.

| [![An XOR gate can be implemented from a mux simply by connecting the select to one of the inputs, and the inputs to A and Abar respectively.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTTz2Ai3ISJJITOXI0R2Xy-e9YDlY-XgaEOsNPOGmWVwIROsy5LIPvKJUHHyq4YxLszRCCpwEcNxHWOSZ3WihcGg055Wp7t8k0jNauBsYrK1glEpO_QeInt8-cVHntBKAFO0AStjQYuDLc/s400/xor+using+mux.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTTz2Ai3ISJJITOXI0R2Xy-e9YDlY-XgaEOsNPOGmWVwIROsy5LIPvKJUHHyq4YxLszRCCpwEcNxHWOSZ3WihcGg055Wp7t8k0jNauBsYrK1glEpO_QeInt8-cVHntBKAFO0AStjQYuDLc/s1600/xor+using+mux.png) |

I hope you’ve found this post useful. Let me know what you think in the comments. I’d love to hear from you all.
**2-input XNOR gate using a 2:1**
**multiplexer**: Similarly, the truth table of XNOR gate can be written as:
|     |     |     |
| A | B | OUT |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
Truth
table of XNOR gate
In the truth table, if we fix, say
A, then
**OUT = B WHEN A = 1, ELSE B’**
Thus, XNOR gate is the complement
of XOR gate. It can be implemented if we connect A to IN1 and Abar to IN0.

### 63. Latch using 2:1 MUX

**Date:** 2016-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/05/latch-using-multiplexer.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/05/latch-using-multiplexer.html)

### Latch using 2:1 MUX
As we know, a 2:1 multiplexer selects between two inputs depending upon the value of its select
input. Also, a latch holds its previous value when its enable pin is in a
particular state (‘0’ for positive level sensitive latch and ‘1’ for negative
level sensitive latch).
So, to build a
positive level sensitive latch from a multiplexer, short the output with IN0
pin of the multiplexer and connect data input to IN1 and Clock input to SEL pin
of multiplexer. A negative level latch can also be built similarly. Figure 1
below shows the diagram representation for the same.

### 64. String class vs dynamically allocated array

**Date:** 2016-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/05/string-class-vs-dynamically-allocated.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/05/string-class-vs-dynamically-allocated.html)

### String class vs dynamically allocated array
String class should be
preferred over dynamically allocated array due to following limitations of dynamically allocated arrays:
1. Whenever user calls new operator, it becomes her/his responsibility to delete it as well to avoid memory
    leaks.
2.  User must ensure that
    correct form of delete is called. For a single element allocation delete
    should be used and  for an array allocation delete\[\] should be used.
    If wrong version is used it may result into undefined behavior.
3. User has to make sure that there
    is single delete for one allocation.
string class provides
function c\_str() for backward compatibility with C API's that expects char\* as
argument. Hence there is no reason for not to use string in place of array of
char.
But, in **_Multi-threaded_**
**_environment,_** there can be performance issues with string class
because of reference counting( [wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting)) optimization. Basically, reference counting
optimization can eliminate unnecessary memory allocations and copying of
characters. But in multi-threaded environment, time saved by avoiding
unnecessary allocations and copying is dwarfed by time spent on behind the
scenes for concurrency control.
Hence in multi threaded
environment, user has following options :
1. Check for library implementation
    of string class if it allows you to disable reference counting
    optimization.
2. check for alternative
    implementation of string class that do not have reference-counting
    optimization that can be checked in copy constructor of class.
3. consider using vector<char>
    instead of string.  String class' member functions will not be
    available but most of the functionality is available through STL
    algorithms.
Option 1 & 2 are not
even solutions that are just checking string class or library implementation.
Option 3 is areal solution.
Hope you’ve found this
post useful. Let us know what you think in the comments.

### 65. What is Static Timing Analysis?

**Date:** 2016-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/05/what-is-static-timing-analysis.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/05/what-is-static-timing-analysis.html)

### What is Static Timing Analysis?
Static timing
analysis (STA) is an analysis method of computing the max/min delay values of a
complete circuit without actually simulating the full circuit. In STA, static
delays such as gate delay and net delays are considered in each path. These
delays are, then, compared against the required bounds on the delay values
and/or the relationship between the delays of different gates. In STA, the
circuit to be analyzed is broken down into timing paths consisting of gates,
registers and nets connecting these. Normally, timing paths start from and end
at registers or chip boundary. Based on origin and termination of data, timing
paths can be categorized into four categories:
        1.)Input to register paths: These paths start at
chip boundary from input ports and end at registers
        2.)Register to register paths: These paths start at
register output pin and terminate at register input   pin
        3.)Register to output paths: These paths start at a
register and end at chip boundary output ports
        4.)Input to output paths: These paths start from
chip boundary at input port and end at chip               boundary at output port
Timing path from
each start-point to end-point are constrained to have maximum and minimum
delays. For example, for register to register paths, each path can take maximum
of one clock cycle (minus input/output delay in case of input/output to
register paths). The minimum delay of a path is governed by hold timing
requirement of the endpoints. Thus, the maximum delay taken by a timing path
governs the maximum frequency of operation.
As stated
before, Static timing analysis does timing analysis without actually simulating
the circuit. The delays of cells are picked from respecting technology
libraries. The delays are available in libraries in tabulated form on the basis
of input transition and output load, which have been calculated based by
simulating the cells for a range of boundary conditions. Net delays are
calculated based upon R and C models.
One important
characteristic of static timing analysis that must be discussed is that static
timing analysis checks the static delay requirements of the circuit without
applying any vectors, hence, the delays calculated are the maximum and minimum
bounds of the delays that will occur in real application scenarios with vectors
applied. This enables the static timing analysis to be fast and inclusive of
all the boundary conditions. Dynamic timing analysis, on the contrary, applies
input vectors, so is very slow. It is necessary to certify the functionality of
the design. Thus, static timing analysis guarantees the timing of the design
whereas dynamic timing analysis guarantees functionality for real application
specific input vectors.

### 66. VLSI design interview questions

**Date:** 2016-05

### VLSI design interview questions
VLSI stands for Very Large Scale Integration and it enables the creation of integrated circuits by incorporating thousands, and even millions of transistors on a single chip. Before VLSI, only small functionalities could be integrated onto a chip. Most of the ICs could perform only a small set of functions such as ALU, counters etc. With the help of VLSI technology, it has become possible to get a whole system designed on a single chip.
Getting into the field of VLSI demands knowledge of some of the basic concepts, be it systems design, timing analysis, RTL design etc. We have tried to collate a few of the topics in the links below. Going through these should be helpful for you. Looking for your feedback for further improvement.

### 67. Defining a clock signal in VHDL

**Date:** 2016-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/clock-in-vhdl.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/clock-in-vhdl.html)

### Defining a clock signal in VHDL
Defining a clock
signal in VHDL
Clock is the
backbone of any synchronous design. For test-benches, a clock is the most
desired signal as almost every design requires a clock. Going a bit deeper, a
clock signal is a binary signal that changes state every few time units. So,
defining a clock in VHDL is pretty simple, as shown below in the following code:
                signal my\_clock :
std\_logic;
                process
                                my\_clock
<= ‘0’;
                                wait
for 5 ns;
                                my\_clock
= ‘1’;
                                wait
for 5 ns;
                end process;
The above code
defines a clock of  period 10 ns with 5
ns high time and 5 ns low time, hence, 50% duty cycle. Since, we are assigning
a value to my\_clock in the code, it can wither be defines as a signal or an
output. Most probably, clocks are defined in test-benches, hence, are internal
signals. High time and low time don’t always need to be same. You can always
define a clock that has different high and low times as shown below:
signal my\_clock : std\_logic;
                process
                                my\_clock
<= ‘0’;
                                wait
for 8 ns;
                                my\_clock
= ‘1’;
                                wait
for 2 ns;
                end process;
As we can see, now, my\_clock has
a duty cycle of 80%; i.e. a high time of 80% and a low time of 20%.
Defining a clock
in this way, obviously, is not synthesizable as we are using delays in code,
and delays cannot be synthesized. Hence, this way of defining a clock can only
be used in a test-bench to test a piece of code. If you need to write a
synthesizable clock, then you have to use structural coding. The simplest of
clock generation circuits is a ring counter (a chain of inverters connected
back-to-back), but it will have a variable frequency clock because delay of
inverters changes on change in operating conditions.

### 69. some good reads about  process

**Date:** 2016-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/some-good-reads-about-process.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/some-good-reads-about-process.html)

### some good reads about process
Today I was supposed to write a function that finds user name or user Id who is running the application. I was looking for C++ APIs that can bring this information for me. I found two API's _getuid_ and _geteuid._ I could not understand the difference between these two So I did some research around it and  found one interesting paper and a nice example. unfortunately I could not read it the whole paper but it looks cool stuff so I thought of sharing it with you. You can check links in _References_ at the end of post:
**Some facts about process :** Each process has a set of user Ids and group Ids that determines which system resources like network ports and files a process can access. Certain privileged User Id or group Ids allow a process to access restricted  system resources. E.g. 0 id is preserved for superuser _root_ and allows a process to access all resources.
Each process has three Ids :
Real User ID(ruid) : It identifies owner of process.
Effective user ID(euid) : It is used in most access control decisions.
Saved ID (suid): It stores previous User ID so that it can be used later.
Similarly a process has three group Ids :Real group ID, Effective Group ID,Saved Group ID that has the same meaning as corresponding user ID.
In linux, a process has _fsuid_ and _fsgid_ as well for access control to filesystem. _fsuid_ usually follows the value in _euid_ unless it is not set by _setfsuid_ and similarly _fsgid_ follows the same value in effective group ID unless explicitly set by _setfsgid._
Since access control is based on _effective user-id_, A process gains privilege by assigning a privileged user ID to its effective ID and drops privilege by removing privilege user ID from effective user ID. Privilege can be removed temporary or permanently.
**Gaining or removing privilege temporary :** Process assigns the privileged user ID to process's effective user-ID and move original effective IDsaved ID so that later privilege can be removed.
_**Gaining or removing privilege permanently :**_ Process assigns or remove the privileged ID from all three User-IDs. As there is no way left to retrieve the previous id privilege is gained or removed permanently respectively.

### 70. Can pure virtual functions be defined as well?

**Date:** 2016-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/can-pure-virtual-functions-be-defined.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/can-pure-virtual-functions-be-defined.html)

### Can pure virtual functions be defined as well?
A class that contains pure virtual functions is called _abstract_ or _interface class_ and concrete class derived from _abstract_ class is called _implementation class_. Since _abstract_ class just defines the interface i.e. what data a class contain and what operations can be performed on it. Virtual functions in abstract class are usually declared but not defined. It is the responsibility of derived class to define it.
Declaration of pure virtual function in C++:
_**virtual <return type> <user defined function name>(<arguments>) = 0;**_
e.g.
virtual void Speak(int a) =  0;
But compiler does not complain even if you give the definition of pure virtual function and in some cases it is useful. Let us try to understand where it can be helpful and when that function get called as there can not be object of _abstract_ class.
Let us say we have base class _Aeroplane_ and _AeroplaneA_ and _AeroplaneB_ are derived from it. class _Aeroplane_ has a method called _fly()_ that defines general way of flying. Let us say _AeroplaneA_ and _AeroplaneB_  have their own way of flying because they are special sort of planes (Jet or something :P). How can we design it in C++?
**First approach:** Make function _fly()_ _pure virtual_ and define the _fly()_ function in every class which is an intuitive solution.
But let us say for another 3 _Aeroplanes C, D_ and _E_ have same general of flying(They are not special kind of planes). In that case you will have to copy the code of _fly()_ function of _Aeroplane_ class to the _fly()_ function of class _AeroplaneC_, _AeroplaneD_ and _AeroplaneE_ that is duplicate code and moreover let us say there is some bug in flying functionality you will have to change 3 functions and you may forget to modify one or two of them. Hence It is really difficult to maintain.
_class Aeroplane {_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_public :_
_virtual void fly() = 0;_
_} ;_
_class AeroplaneA : public Aeroplane{_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_public :_
_virtual void fly() {_
_//own functionality_
_}_
_} ;_
_class AeroplaneB : public Aeroplane{_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_public :_
_virtual void fly() {_
_//own functionality_
_}_
_} ;_
_class AeroplaneC : public Aeroplane{_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_public :_
_virtual void fly() {_
_// general fly functionality **Duplicate code**_
_}_
_} ;_
_class AeroplaneD : public Aeroplane{_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_public :_
_virtual void fly() {_
_// general fly functioanlity.. **Duplic** **ate code**_
_}_
_} ;_
_//similarly for AeroplaneE_
**Second Approach** :  Make function _fly()_ virtual instead of pure virtual. Put the general flying functionality in _fly()_ function of _Aeroplane class_ and whichever class wants to override this functionality it can do.
    Now we don't need to declare _fly()_ function in _AeroplaneC,AeroplaneD_ and _AeroplaneE_. Hence for objects of type _AeroplaneA_ or _AeroplaneB_ their own version of _fly()_ will be called. and for rest of the _Aeroplanes_ general _fly()_ function in _Aeroplane_ class will be called.
_class Aeroplane {_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_public :_
_virtual void fly() {_
_// general fly functionality_
_}_
_} ;_
_class AeroplaneA___: public Aeroplane_{_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_public :_
_virtual void fly() {_
_//own functionality_
_}_
_} ;_
_class AeroplaneB___: public Aeroplane_{_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_public :_
_virtual void fly() {_
_//own functionality_
_}_
_} ;_
_class AeroplaneC___: public Aeroplane_{_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_**// don't need to define fly function here**_
_} ;_
_class AeroplaneD____: public Aeroplane__{_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
__**// don't need to define fly function here**__
_} ;_
It looks perfect. Isn't it?
But unfortunately answer is **No.** It can also cause some problems. e.g.
Let us say another _AeroplaneF(special plane)_ which has its own way of flying is introduced and designer forget to over ride the _fly()_ function, compiler will not complain, your code will just start working without even a warning. It will be caught as part of bug etc. But what if it is not even caught in testing? For crucial and such critical design you can not take risk or you should not do such mistakes. During the actual run, your _Aeroplane_ may just crash. :(
So what do we do? Neither solution looks like a good solution. Both are bug prone.
Don't worry we will not let your plane crash.. :) C++ compiler gives you a very nice solution for such problems.
**_Solution :_** **_Define pure virtual function._** By defining pure virtual function, we can put general _fly()_ functionality in _fly()_ function of _Aeroplane_ and since _fly()_ function is pure virtual all concrete class needs to redefine it and there we can simply call _fly()_ function of class _Aeroplane_. Hence we have taken care of both problems.  Now there is no duplicate code and compiler enforces you to define virtual function in each concrete class.
_class Aeroplane {_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_public :_
_virtual void fly() = 0 {_
_**// general fly functionality**_
_}_
_} ;_
_class AeroplaneA____: public Aeroplane__{_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_public :_
_virtual void fly() {_
_//own functionality_
_}_
_} ;_
_class AeroplaneB____: public Aeroplane__{_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_public :_
_virtual void fly() {_
_//own functionality_
_}_
_} ;_
_class AeroplaneC____: public Aeroplane__{_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
_**virtual void fly() {**_
_**Aeroplane::fly();**_
_**}**_
_} ;_
_class AeroplaneD____: public Aeroplane__{_
_// constructor,destrcutor etc_
__**_**virtual void fly() {**_**__
_**Aeroplane::fly();**_
_**}**_
_} ;_

### 71. Dead reference Problem and its detection

**Date:** 2016-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/dead-reference-problem-and-its-detection.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/dead-reference-problem-and-its-detection.html)

### Dead reference Problem and its detection
In [Meyer's singleton pattern](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/search?updated-max=2016-04-17T09:37:00-07:00&max-results=1), we saw how we can use meyer's implementation approach of singleton design pattern to destroy the singleton object efficiently.It seems perfect at the first glance. However, it has certain problem called **Dead reference problem**. Let us try to understand it with the help of an example :
Let us say there are two static objects of class A and B and we have a singleton design pattern class called _**log**_ that errors out if there is some error in creation or deletion of A or B. As we had studied in the last post that singleton object is created in Instance() function when it is called first time. A and B calls Instance() function of _**log**_ while initialization and destruction if there occurs some error. Let us say object of A got created successfully  but while constructing object of B there comes some error and it calls Instance() function of **log** Hence singleton object got created and possibly whole application exits out after this. **Since compiler destroys local static object in the reverse order of their creation** Hence log will be destroyed before object of A and let us say there occurs some error in destruction of A _Instance()_ function return an Invalid object and program can behave unexpected. This is called _dead reference problem_.
Before thinking its solution we should understand what the real problem is. Problem is that we do not know the order of creation of object of A,B and log. A and B should follow the C++ rule(last object created first) but _log_ should be exempted from this rule. _log_ should destroyed after destruction of A and B so that it can catch all errors thrown by creation or destroy of A and B.
We have no way yet to control lifetime of objects (at least not in this post) but we can atleast _detect dead reference problem_ that can be done by keeping a _static_ _bool_ variable called _deleted\__ inside singleton class which is initialized to _false_ and set to true in its destructor.
class Singelton {
static bool deleted\_;
public :
Singleton& Instance() {
    if( !deleted ) {
          static singleton obj;
         return obj;
    } else {
        throw std::runtime\_error("dead reference detected") ;
    }
}
~Singeton() {
     inst\_ = 0;
    deleted\_ = true;
}
};
bool Singleton::deleted\_ = false;
If some object tries to access singleton after its destruction, It will throw an error.

### 72. How to automatically include header dependencies in makefile

**Date:** 2016-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/how-to-automatically-include-header.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/how-to-automatically-include-header.html)

### How to automatically include header dependencies in makefile
**Why automate inclusion of header file dependencies**: While working on a new project, I had to write a makefile from
scratch. I found it little challenging to find out how to
automatically include header dependencies in makefile, because everytime you include some header file in your source file, you can not modify your
makefile. So, I thought, there must be some mechanism that automatically takes
care of it. If you search on google, you will find various ways.
Manual solution is to use sed command that I guess searches for #includes
in your source code and puts all those dependencies in your makefile. But
with modern compiler, you dont need to do much. It will do your job. You
just need to pass some flags to it.
For instance, with gcc version 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-51), before including header dependencies, target to make object file was
> **./%.o : ../%.cpp**
>
> **g++ -c $(INC\_PATH) $(FLAGS)  $< -o $@**
>
> **./%.o : ../%.cpp**
>
> **g++ -c $(INC\_PATH) $(FLAGS) -MMD -MP $< -o $@**
-include $(SRC\_FILES:.cpp=.d)
you just need to pass -MMD and \_MP flag and need to include these dependencies (.d file).
### **See the below example that demonstrate it**
Let us say we have 3 c++ and 3 header files :
1. test.cxx
2. add.cxx
3. sub.cxx
4. test.h
5. sub.h
6. add.h
**add.cxx** includes **add.h**
**sub.cxx** includes **sub.h**
**test.cxx** includes **test.h** , **add.h** and **sub.h**
Following is the makefile that only includes dependencies of .cxx files  :
\-\-\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\### declaration of all variables
FLAGS := -g
COMPILER := g++
SRC\_FILES := $(wildcard \*.cxx)
OBJ\_FILES := $(SRC\_FILES:%.cxx=%.o)
.PHONY  : all clean
EXE := my\_exe
STATIC\_LIB := my\_exe.a
all : $(EXE)
\### compile source files to make object files
\### expand this section for each object file to include dependency of header files
\## NAAAA I am not gonna do it..  :P
%.o : %.cxx
        $(COMPILER) -c $(FLAGS) $< -o $@
\### make static libary of object files
$(STATIC\_LIB) : $(OBJ\_FILES)
    ar -crv $@ $^
\### make executable
$(EXE) : $(STATIC\_LIB)
    $(COMPILER) $^ -o $@
\# clean all the files
clean :
    rm -rf $(OBJ\_FILES) $(EXE) $(STATIC\_LIB)
\-\-\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you do any changes in .h file and try to do "make" it will say **nothing to be done for 'all'**  as we have no where mentioned that any of my target depends on header file.
Hence,  to include dependency of header files I should explicitly include
header files in my makefile but what if I add one more header file in
test.cxx? I will again need to modify makefile which is a cumbersome
task and non-practical in a real project.
Today compiler provides you facility to automatically generate dependency graph. All you need to do is to just pass some flags.
e.g. with _g++_ compiler you should give **_-MMD -MP_** flag. It will generate _dependency file(.d)_ for each object file and include those dependency files in makefile as follow :
\-\-\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\## not including variable declaration part
%.o : %.cxx
**$(COMPILER) -c $(FLAGS) -MMD -MP $< -o $@**
\### include all dependency files
**-include $(SRC\_FILES:.cxx=.d)**
$(STATIC\_LIB) : $(OBJ\_FILES)
    ar -crv $@ $^
$(EXE) : $(STATIC\_LIB)
    $(COMPILER) $^ -o $@
clean :
    rm -rf $(OBJ\_FILES) $(EXE) $(STATIC\_LIB)
\-\-\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_**Test.d :**_
test.o: test.cxx add.h sub.h test.h
add.h:
sub.h:
test.h:
This is how a dependency files look like. Now _test.o_ depends on  _test.h, add.h and sub.h_ along with _test.cxx_. similarly _add.o_ includes dependency of _add.h_ and _sub.o_ takes _sub.h_ into account.
Whenever time stamp of any of header file changes corresponding object file will be modified that solves our purpose. :)

### 73. Meyer's Singleton pattern

**Date:** 2016-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/meyers-singleton-pattern.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/meyers-singleton-pattern.html)

### Meyer's Singleton pattern
Singleton pattern is my all time favorite. Some people call it anti-pattern as they use it even when it is not actually required. Today, I was reading about singleton pattern and found so many interesting things about it.
**static data + static functions != singleton pattern**
Static class (a class that contains only static data and functions) and singleton pattern are not same. In some cases it may seem same, but with static classes there are some problems e.g.
1. You can not extend its functionality by inheritance since static functions can not be virtual.
2. Initialization and clean up is very difficult in static classes; since there is no central point of initialization or clean up; i.e. data is not bound with constructor or destructor as the whole data is static.
Singleton design pattern takes care of this along with focusing on the fact that there is a single object in the execution of program.
Given below is one design variant of singleton design pattern :
> class singleton {
>
>      singleton \*pinst\_;
>
>     singleton() {};
>
>     singleton(const singelton&) ;
>
>    operator =(const singleton&);
>
> public:
>
>    static singleton\* Instance() {
>
>       if(pinst\_ == NULL)
>
>          pinst\_ = new singleton();
>
>       return pinst\_;
>
>    }
>
> };
Since all constructors are private, user is not allowed to create its instance. Hence, uniqueness is enforced at compile time. If Instance function is never called, no object is created at all. Instance of singleton is created when Instance is called first time. This optimization is useful, if size of class is too big to be very expensive, but what if singleton object is not too big.
In that case, one can keep static object of  singleton class instead of pointer as follow :
**Another design Invariant :**
> class singleton {
>
>      singleton inst\_;
>
>     singleton() {};
>
>     singleton(const singelton&) ;
>
>    operator =(const singleton&);
>
> public:
>
>    static singleton\* Instance() {
>
>       return &inst\_; // return its reference
>
>    }
>
> };
in implementation file
> singleton singleton::inst\_; // initializing static object.
This is not a good solution although everything is same in second invariant as well except that in 2nd approach there is static object and in first there is pointer.
In second approach, inst\_ is initialized dynamically at runtime and in first approach it happens statically (It is a type without constructor initialized with compile time constant). .
**The compiler performs static initialization before the very first assembly statement gets executed. But compiler does not define the order of initialization for dynamically initialized objects found in different translation unit (A compilable source file).**
> int global = singleton::Instance().do\_something();
depending on the order chosen by compiler to initialize global and inst\_ singleton::Instance() may return an object that has not been even constructed yet.
**Destroying singleton :** As we discussed above, first approach is more reliable than the second one. But it has problem that when and how to destroy the static singleton object. Like there is a function Instance(), we can make a public function destroy() that will call destructor but one has to be very careful that nobody access the object after it has been destroyed. we would not have to face this problem if we have used second approach but definitely that is more dangerous. Scott meyer came up with another approach. Therefore, people refer it as **_Meyer's singleton._**
> singleton& singleton::Instance {
>
>    static singleton obj; //function static object
>
>    return obj;
>
> }
Function static object is initialized when control flow hits this function first time. Primitive static variables are initialized with compile time constants. e.g
> int func() {
>
>   static int x=100;
>
>   return x++;
>
> }
In this case, x is initialized to 100 before any code in the program is executed most likely at the load time. When the static variable is not compile time constant or an object with a constructor it is initialized when the program hits for first time.
A pseudo C++ code generated by compiler :
> singleton& singleton::Instance() {
>
> _// functions generated by compiler_ _extern void \_\_ConstructorSingleton(void \*memory);_ _extern void \_\_DestroySingleton();_ _// objects created by compiler_ _static bool \_\_initialized  = false;_ _static char \_\_buffer\[sizeof(singleton)\];_ _if(! \_\_initialized) {_ _\_\_ConstructorSingleton(\_\_buffer);_ _**atexit(\_\_DestroySingleton);**_ _\_\_initialized = true;_ _}_ _return \*reinterpret\_cast<singleton\*>(\_\_buffer);_}
Main part here is _atexit_ function, which is provided by standard c library. It allows register function to be called automatically during program's exit.
Each call to atexit function pushes its parameter on a private stack maintained by C runtime library. During application's exit, these functions are called.
**P.S**
_In subsequent  posts we will disucss about following things in more details :_
1. _The_
_compiler performs static initialization before the very first assembly_
_statement gets executed. But compiler does not define the order of_
_initialization for dynamically initialized objects found in different_
_translation unit(A compilable source file)._

### 74. Comparison between Array, Linked List and Vector

**Date:** 2016-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/array-linked-list-vector.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/array-linked-list-vector.html)

### Comparison between Array, Linked List and Vector
Arrays, linked lists and vectors are used as a storage for multiple element components. Each of these has its own merits and demerits in terms of memory occupied, speed of traversal and complexity. In this post, we will try to have a brief but concise comparison between the three:
**Array :** Array is a data structure that can store a fixed number of elements of of similar type at **contiguous** memory locations.
In C, the most simple way to declare an array is as shown below:
> int a\[10\];
|     |
| [![The elements of an array are stored at contiguous locations. For example, let us say, if the array is an array of integers of 4-bit each and first element is stored at location 100, the subsequent elements will be stored at locations 104, 108 and so on.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjY2xvkve5rKTfDqv0WetOuCKu2_ogDxoilAOZkHEq0KMRiv-xHAspN4DV7rxxZAP4V6-QKA-I3YxpAPpE1_GOsQGvbdiyZObHM_RcU5QKGFKoY8_5kzYbYo_eJPE2SL8Zx6mG_KKElmarb/s320/qa.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjY2xvkve5rKTfDqv0WetOuCKu2_ogDxoilAOZkHEq0KMRiv-xHAspN4DV7rxxZAP4V6-QKA-I3YxpAPpE1_GOsQGvbdiyZObHM_RcU5QKGFKoY8_5kzYbYo_eJPE2SL8Zx6mG_KKElmarb/s1600/qa.png) |
| **Figure 1: Storage of array elements** |
This statement will create an array of 10 integer elements located at contiguous locations as can be seen in figure 1 alongside. Let us say, first element is located at 100th location in memory; then, second element will be at 104th location assuming the size of integer as 4 (although size of integer depends on machine. On 64 bit machine, size of integer will be 8 byte ) and third element will be located at  108 and so on.
**NOTE**: The given example of storage of array in memory does not represent real memory locations. This is just for the sake of understanding.
Since, array elements are located at contiguous memory locations, rate to access any element in array is constant O(1). e.g. nth element can be accessed as :
    base address + (n-1)\*size of element
e.g. 3rd element is present at 100 + 2\*4 = 108th address.
**Advantages of array** : As explained, array has high access rate of order O(1) i.e. constant access rate. The access time for a very large array can be reasonably small.
**Disadvantages :** 1) Since size of array is constant. It has to be pre-determined, as that much amount of memory has to be reserved which has to be contiguous locations, which can lead to memory wastage.
2) If memory is fragmented into smaller chunks then array creation may fail, because array elements are stored at contiguous locations. e.g. let us say, there is a space of 1024 bytes in memory but memory is fragmented into 2 chunks of 512 bytes. Then, maximum size allowed of an array will be 512 although total available space is 1024 bytes.
3) Insertion and deletion in the middle of array is a costly operation because elements to the right of required position has to be moved.
**Linked List :** Due to the disadvantages of array related to insertion and deletion time, Linked list came into existence. Linked list is a linear data structure that can store collection of data elements. Number of elements to be stored in linked list need not to be constant. It can be dynamic. Elements in linked list need not to be stored at contiguous locations. Since, elements are not kept at contiguous locations, each element contain the location (address) of next element.
Hence, data elements in Linked list consist of two parts:
1. Data and
2. Address of next element.
The structure representing an element in a linked list can be defined in C as shown below
> struct link\_list {**int data;** **struct link\_list \*next;**};
|     |
| ![A linked list consists of two parts: data and address of next element.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_jia2J5kt2jCnL48rl_dw0tP8q_w0XAC91whGOyKDWJtEpwxm87FbmeJAtd1cCFVqo4DOcMwYWsvukjuvwN8KrZaeG-5gxKVtkHf1ShyphenhypheniyKPYL92s25IPMA5ymyZSxds8xkX1draFbSi6/s400/dia.jpg) |
| **Figure 2: Linked list representation** |
**Advantages of Linked List :** 1) Size of linked list need not to be constant. It can be dynamically decided at the run time.
2) Insertion and deletion in the middle of linked list is of order of 1, O(1) i.e it is constant. It just requires changing the pointers.e.g If you want to add an element  at 3rd position i.e. after 200, 2nd node will point to location 250 instead of 300 and new location 250 will point to 300.
**Disadvantages :** 1) Access rate is lesser than that of array. Complexity of accessing element is of order of n O(n) where n is number of elements in linked list because one has to traverse through all the element to access last element.
2) **Extra memory cost**. An element in a list does not contain only data, but pointer to next element as well.   If data is some huge object say 128 bytes, then pointer of size 4 bytes is not a big overhead but if the data is itself of size 4 bytes like an integer then size of each element will be doubled.
**Vector :** Vector is a data structure which provides advantages of both linked list and array. Major advantage of array is higher access rate and that of linked list is dynamic size. A vector is a hybrid of these two.
Vector data structure internally uses an array of some user defined size let us say N. When the user tries to put N+1th element in vector following operations takes place:
1.   It internally creates a new array of double size i.e. 2N
2.  Copies the element of previous array into newer one,
3.  Destroy the previous array
4.  New array comes in place of previous one.
From this, we can see that extending size of vector is a heavy operation. Hence there is always a trade off between speed and memory. Because, if you choose smaller size initially; then, you are making sure that memory is not wasted. But as soon as your size reaches threshold and new element is to be inserted, above described operation takes place which slows down your activity. On the other hand, if you choose initially larger size, one can get rid of above operations. But then, memory may get wasted. In such cases where we over-estimate size, there is no difference between an array of max size and vector.
So, its a tricky part to choose initial size of vector. You have to choose wisely which depends upon application to application.If you don't mention the size of vector while construction then compiler chooses a default size that I guess depend upon library implementation.
There are so many other linear data structures like skip list, deque etc that tries to optimize the performance and tries to make use of advantages provided by linked list and array.

### 1. Noise margins

**Date:** 2015-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/09/noise-margins.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/09/noise-margins.html)

### Noise margins
In this realistic world, nothing is ideal. A signal travelling
along a wire/cable/transmission line is susceptible to noise from the
surroundings. Also, there is degradation in signal due to parasitic elements
involved in the line. Moreover, the output signal produced by the transmitter
itself only does resemble the ideal signal thereby worsening the scenario. There
are repeaters/buffers along the line to minimize the impact of noise. But there
is a limit up to which degradation is allowed beyond which the receiver is
unable to sense the correct value of the signal. This degradation is measured
in terms of noise margins. One can find the topic discussed in all the
textbooks related to digital logic and system design might it be CMOS, TTL or any
other logic family.
Let us illustrate the concept of noise margins with the help of an
example. Let us assume that a signal has to travel from a transmitter to a
receiver through an inter-connect element (or, commonly called as a net) which will only degrade the signal, since there is no active element in-between transmitter and receiver. The
output signal produced by Transmitter (Tx) will deviate from ideal voltage
levels as is shown in figures 1 and 2 for logic level ‘1’. In addition, there
will be signal degradation by inter-connect element as well as noise induced
from the surroundings. As a result, the band of voltages that can be present at
the receiver input for logic ‘1’ will further widen. Now, there are two cases:
1. If the band voltages recognized as logic ‘1’ by the receiver is
super-set of the band of voltages that can exist at the receiver input as shown
in figure 1, receiver will recognize the transmitted logic ‘1’ for all the
cases. This is the desired scenario as no logic ‘1’ transmitted will be missed
by the receiver. This scenario is depicted in figure 1, wherein the noise induced by surroundings is such that the range of voltages present at the receiver does not violate the band of voltages recognized as voltage '1' by the receiver. So, it will be recognized correctly as logic '1' by the receiver.
|     |
| [![When the noise induced is less than noise margin, it will be captured properly by the receiver](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdjDGc0xjPY1MxDjSSVk7T97gf5cpbUiNCl0NH3qVOXLuYa2IEde_bMxr0-ugIdObohaKOYIsRBD2oExBeR3UuYZ6zi2EixkW-yS6XdAeilNYbQ0F1XMpihegw3R698WnxQOFct6UjD0Uv/s640/voltage_at_receiver_within_range.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdjDGc0xjPY1MxDjSSVk7T97gf5cpbUiNCl0NH3qVOXLuYa2IEde_bMxr0-ugIdObohaKOYIsRBD2oExBeR3UuYZ6zi2EixkW-yS6XdAeilNYbQ0F1XMpihegw3R698WnxQOFct6UjD0Uv/s1600/voltage_at_receiver_within_range.png) |
| **Figure 1: Figure showing the noise induced is less than noise margin** |
2)If the band
of values recognized as logic ‘1’ by the receiver is a sub-set of the band of
voltages that can exist at the receiver input as shown in figure 2, there will
be some cases that will not be recognized as logic ‘1’, but are intended to be
recognized. So, there will be a loss of information/incorrect transmission of
information possible in such cases. This scenario is depicted in figure 2, wherein the noise induced by surroundings makes the band of voltage at the receiver's input larger than that can be decoded correctly as logic '1' by the receiver. So, there is no guarantee that the signal will be perceived as logic '1' by the receiver.

| [![Figure showing the noise induced is less than noise margin. In case this happens, the signal will not be correctly decoded by the receiver.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIQkZgZXL-f2mRim2n1xVLaBW_rdnfTWC_6tjHIcitB1oI79gKUkdGl3Do5vJ2gUoHICpsLJMpiMUPgoO7Jy8E2B3P6mndL3C38A6cnEibaRyyh_pAITTgG5XrYtXDEljD-ejzqnQZemdz/s640/voltage_at_receiver_outside_range.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIQkZgZXL-f2mRim2n1xVLaBW_rdnfTWC_6tjHIcitB1oI79gKUkdGl3Do5vJ2gUoHICpsLJMpiMUPgoO7Jy8E2B3P6mndL3C38A6cnEibaRyyh_pAITTgG5XrYtXDEljD-ejzqnQZemdz/s1600/voltage_at_receiver_outside_range.png) |
| |     |
| **Figure 2: Figure showing the noise induced is greater than noise margin** | |
Let
us now label each of these regions to make the discussion more meaningful. The
lowest voltage that will be produced as logic ‘1’ by the transmitter is termed
as VOH and, let us say, highest is VDD. (We are here considered about lower
level only). So, the range of voltages produced by the transmitter is (VDD –
VOH).  And let the receiver accept
voltages higher than VIH. So the range of voltages accepted by the receiver
will be (VDD – VIH). So, the maximum degradation that can happen over the
communication channel is (VOH – VIH) which is nothing but the noise margin. If
the degradation is less than this figure, the logic ‘1’ will be recognized
correctly by the receiver; otherwise it won’t. So, the noise margin equation can be given as below for logic '1':
Noise margin for logic '1' (NM) = VOH – VIH
Where
VOH = Lowest level of voltage that can be produced as logic '1' by the transmitter
VIH = Lowest level of voltage that can be recognized as logic '1' by the receiver
Similarly, for logic ‘0’, the range of outputs that can be
produced by the transmitter is (0 - VOL) and the range of input voltages that
can be detected by the receiver is (0 – VIL), thereby providing the noise
margin as:
Noise margin (NM) = VIL – VOL
Where
VIL = Highest level of voltage that can be recognized as logic ‘0’ by the receiver.
VIH = Highest level of voltage that is produced as logic ‘0’ by the transmitter.
Figure 3 shows all these levels for the example we had taken earlier to demonstrate the concept of noise margins.

| |     |
| **Figure 3: Noise margin** | |
From out preceding discussion, if the degradation over the communication channel is more than noise margin, it will not be detected correctly by the receiver. So, it is imperative for the designer to design accordingly.
**Definition of noise margin**: Thus, we can conclude this post by defining noise margin as below:
> "Noise margin is the difference between the worst signal voltage produced by
> the transmitter and the worst signal that can be detected by receiver."

### 2. Timing arcs

**Date:** 2015-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/08/timing-arcs.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/08/timing-arcs.html)

### Timing arcs
**What is a timing**
**arc**: A timing arc defines the propagation of signals through logic gates/nets and defines a timing relationship between two related pins. **Timing arc is one of the components of a timing path**. Static timing analysis works on the concept of timing paths. Each
path starts from either primary input or a register and ends at a primary output or a register. In-between, the path traverses through what are known as **timing arcs**.We can define a timing arc as an **indivisible path/constraint from one pin**
**to another that tells EDA tool to consider the path/relationship between the pins**. For
instance, AND, NAND, NOT, full adder cell etc. gates have arcs from each input
pin to each output pin. Also, sequential cells such as flops and latches have
arcs from clock pin to output pins and data pins. Net connections can also be identified as timing arcs as is discussed later.

| [![Cell arc is the arc from input pin to output pin of a cell. Net arc is an arc from output pin of one cell to input pin of another cell (from driver pin of net to load pin of net)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIkqOsuYx7lY8yA7MOfx4g7pwf7KtZaY4YfWJQF7Ahd1KEd933VR8HJfH90OFpVJM-tOJBp3WJIO3J8jtVPlt0cJSWA113KThbiviG5rZy60D6CLSoHYOLV1qk2pSiybDg0oN9Ql-d9HVa/s640/Timing+arc+showing+cell+and+net+arc.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIkqOsuYx7lY8yA7MOfx4g7pwf7KtZaY4YfWJQF7Ahd1KEd933VR8HJfH90OFpVJM-tOJBp3WJIO3J8jtVPlt0cJSWA113KThbiviG5rZy60D6CLSoHYOLV1qk2pSiybDg0oN9Ql-d9HVa/s1600/Timing+arc+showing+cell+and+net+arc.png) |
| **Figure**<br>**1 : Figure showing cell and net**<br>**arcs** |
**Terminology**: The common terminology related to timing arcs
is as follows:
- **Source**
**pin**: The pin from which timing arc originates (pin IN1 and IN2 for cell arcs, pin OUT for net arc in figure1). This also means constraining pin in case of setup/hold timing checks (for example clock is source pin for setup check)
- **Sink pin**:
The pin at which timing arc ends (pin OUT for cell arc, pin AND2/IN2 for net arc in figure2). This also means constrained pin in case of setup/hold timing arcs (for example data pin is sink pin for setup check)
**Cell arcs and net arcs**: Timing arcs can be categorized into two
categories based upon the type of element they are associated with – cell arcs and net arcs.
- **Cell arcs**:
These are between an input pin and output pin of a cell. In other words, source
pin is an input pin of a cell and sink pin a pin of the same cell (output pin in case of delay arcs and input pin in case of timing check arcs). In the
figure shown above, arcs (IN1 -> OUT) and (IN2 -> OUT) are cell arcs. Cell
arcs are further divided into sequential and combinational arcs as discussed
below.
- **Net arcs**:
These arcs are between driver pin of a net and load pin of a net. In other
words, source pin is an output pin of one cell and sink pin is an input pin of
another cell. In the figure shown above, arc (OUT -> IN2) is a net arc. Net arcs are always delay timing arcs.
**Sequential and**
**combinational arcs**: As discussed above, cell arcs can be sequential or
combinational. Sequential arcs are between the clock pin of a sequential cell
and either input or output pin. Setup and hold arcs are between input data pin
and clock pin and are termed as timing check arcs as they constrain a form of timing relationship between a set of signals. Sequential delay arc is between clock pin and output pin of
sequential elements. An example of sequential delay arc is clk to q delay arc in a flip-flop.  On the other hand, combinational arcs are between an input
data and output data pin of a combinational cell or block.
**Information**
**contained in timing arc**: A delay timing arc provides following information:
1. A delay arc tells whether the path can be traversed through pin1 to
pin2. If the path can be traversed, we say that an arc exists between pin1 and
pin2. On the other hand, a timing check arc tells the relationship that is allowed between a set of signals.
2. Under what condition the path will be traversed,
known as ‘sdf condition’
3. Maximum and minimum times it can take from the source pin to the
destination pin of the arc to traverse in the path
4. Timing sense of the arc as explained below
**Timing sense of an arc**:
Timing sense of an arc is defined as the sense of traversal from source pin of
the timing arc to the sink pin of the timing arc. Timing sense is also called as " **unateness"** of timing arc. Timing sense can be ‘positive
unate’, ‘negative unate’ and ‘non-unate’.
- **P** **ositive unate timing arc**: The unateness of an arc is said to be positive unate if rise transition at the source
pin causes rise transition (if at all) at sink pin and vice-versa.Cells of type AND, OR gate etc. have positive
unate arcs. All net arcs are positive unate arcs.
- **Negative**
**unate timing arc**: The unateness of an arc is said to be negative unate if rise transition at the
source pin causes fall transition at the sink pin and vice-versa. NAND, NOR and
Inverter have negative unate arcs.
- **Non unate timing arcs**: If there is no such relationship between the source and sink pins of
a timing arc, the arc is said to be non-unate. XOR and XNOR gates have non-unate timing
arcs.
**From what source**
**timing arcs are picked**: For cell arcs, the existence of a timing arc is picked
from liberty files. The cell has a function defined that identifies if the arc
is there from its input (say ‘x’) to output (say ‘y’). In most of the cases,
the value (delay, unateness, sd condition etc) of the arc is also picked from liberty; but in case you have read
SDF, the delay is picked from SDF (Standard Delay Format) file (other properties picked from liberty in this case also). On the other hand, for
net arcs, the existence of arc is picked from connectivity information
(netlist). The net arcs are calculated based on the parasitic values given in
SPEF (Standard Parasitics Exchange Format) file, or SDF (like in case above).
**Importance of**
**timing arcs**: Timing arcs have a very important role in VLSI design
industry. Whole of the optimization process right from gate level netlist till
final signoff revolves around timing arcs. The presence of correct timing arcs
in liberty file is very essential for high quality signoff or there may not be
correlation between simulation and silicon).

_**Work Experience in Infosys**_
_Post Btech, many would be getting into the service based companies like Infy, TCS, Capgemini, IBM etc. I would like to share few important information, that would be really useful for many and it would be good to know these before joining._
_With the frustration that I couldn't get much with my GATE Rank and the call letter of Infy coming too early made me join Infosys 2 days immediately after my college._

**Training : - Mysore**
We were given training in Mysore. The training consists of Generic and Stream part. Tell you what, this is the best ever platform that I have ever seen for learning things. The training is too worthy. One never feels like missing any thing there.
The resources are awesome and even if you are not expertise in JAVA, HTML or so, you will be made so , given the resources and the quality of teaching. Yes, it is a bit pressure, having had to sit in class from 9 a.m to 6 p.m., but then it is worthy.
Industrial oriented training given by Infosys is awesome. I don't know much about the other companies but I hope even they maintain standards.
Having completed, generic training which includes - JAVA, HTML, CSS, JS, ORACLE,SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, you will be given streams.
Those who couldn't clear the the Generic part will be given 3 chances to clear their exams and post that they will be given streams, (if cleared )and if not,they will asked to leave the company ( sad right)
The streams are random and this is a bit negative point here in Infosys.
What ever type of person you are, may be a software freak or hater of software, still every one will be enjoying the training because of the standards of teaching and the resources and more than any thing else the fear of getting failed.. ( Of course exams will be there)
**Facilities**
Accomodation:  Ultimate like a five star hotel. But don't dream too much because you will hardly have time to sleep there.
Food : U have food courts where the food is served of different regions and you can enjoy it at reasonable prices
Gym & Swimming Pool: Yes every thing apart from these also there like medical facilities, basket ball court, badminton, Table tennis, cricket and much more.
One thing that I can assure you is that you will be blown out with the beauty of the campus.
I will post few pictures of Infy Mysore DC. in the next post.
If some one has any individual doubts, you can always comment downside and I will answer your queries.

### 7. BARC & IIT Bombay RA Experience

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/barc-iit-bombay-ra-experience.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/barc-iit-bombay-ra-experience.html)

### BARC & IIT Bombay RA Experience
_Went to Bombay a day before. Stayed in IIT Bombay because I had few facebook friends. To my luck , even they had BARC Interview. We all went there.  There was initially a check up of all the certificates and to and from tickets for travel allowance.  The interview went on like this_
_1\. Graph of Voltage across capacitor vrs time with different values of R,L,C in series RLC Circuit._
_2\. Super Diode_
_3\. A lot of confusing questions on whether some Mosfet is depletion or enhancement type._
_4\. Set up and Hold up time_
_5\. Signals and Systems questions were mostly on finding the Fourier series and transform based on symmetry._
_6\. Some quality Control System questions._
_With this.. My tour of India completed._
_Starting from Bangalore to Madras to Delhi to Bombay....................._

_Before putting some thing else, I want to summarize as to what all offers I had in my hand_
_**1\. IIT Bombay - Communications ( 1st round) and Electronics Systems ( 4th round)**_
_**2\. IIT Madras - Communications ( 1st round)**_
_**3\. IIT Delhi - IEC, VDTT**_
_**4\. IIT Kharagpur - Micro Electronics**_
_**5\. IISC Bangalore - Communications and Networking**_
_The below given experience is by my friend K. Bharadwaj. I needn't had to go to IIT Bombay RA. He have put his thoughts. He tasted the success in IIT Bombay RA and I have put his experience._
_**M.Tech (EE)IIT BOMBAY (RA) Experience**_
_It is usually very difficult getting VLSI in old IIT's for ranks above 200(my rank is 295 and score 803 in EC).For such people,IITB provides a golden oppurtunity with M.Tech  as RA(Research Assistant).It's a 3 year course but is nowhere different to two year M.tech as TA(Teaching Assistant).Curriculum,Coursework and placements are all same except that RA has to spend one more year.As an RA,one has to take less courses per semester(3 as against 5 for TA) but has to spend 20 hours of work  per week as against 8 hours of work for TA.There are two kinds of Research assistants_
_1.Institue RA_
_-One has to work in labs like electronics lab,VLSI lab to help undergraduate students in performing experiments.These are concerned with day to day activities of lab including maintainence.Even System administrator comes under this RA._
_2.Project RA_
_-Professors have funded projects from various sources.As a project RA,one has to assist these professors in project and in administrative work also as told by respective guide._
_Now,the difference between them is in chosing guide.Project RA will be assigned a guide at selection and cannot be changed.He is expected to do his thesis work in same area as project alloted while Institute RA has the freedom of choosing guide._
_Selection Process :_
_Cutoff is put in gate score and are called.This year(2015),cutoff  is 660(GEN),596(OBC),440(SC/ST).It means ranks upto 1200 can also be called in GEN_
_There will be a written test and Interview as part of selection process._
**Written Test**:It has objective type questions in which some may require answers in one or two sentences.Time duration is 2 hours
Consisted of 3 sections
Section 1 consists of MATHS,APTITUDE,CONTROL SYSTEMS,ELECTRICAL MACHINES (50 marks as far as  i remember)
Section 2 consists of LINUX Basics(commands,networking ),Communication,DSP questions(50 marks ..or may be 60.. i dont remember exactly)
Section 3 consists of Analog ,digital and electronic devices (50 marks)
There is no need to attempt all sections.Because it is not expected for a core electrical guy to know communications and vice versa.It is essential to score in the area for which you gave preference.Questions level were easy-medium but time was the constraint.this year,paper was lengthy enough that scoring 50 in whole paper is great.I guess my score would be around 45
Now shortlisting happens on following criteria
Institute RA- 50 % gate score ,50 % written test
Project RA-75 % gate score,25 % written test
Till last year 2:1 people were called for the interviews for the number of positons available.But this time it was 3:1.This year number of positions for institute RA are 36(5 were for only electrical)
and 21 for Project RA(5 were pure electrical projects).120 odd people were shortlisted for Institute RA whereas 63 for project RA(around 300 people gave written test).Your name can appear in both lists but will be interviewed only once in which you have to indicate preferences.
This is atleast 2 day process in which first day will be written test.Resullts will be in website by Night.Next day,we assembled at hall and we were given forms for giving preferences in Institute RA(Electronics lab,VLSI lab,System administrator,Communication lab).Projects(abstracts were given to us) seperately for institute RA and Project RA.we were  then addressed by HOD who surprised us with a new proposal this year to check laboratory skills for people who preferred electronics lab in 1st or 2nd choices.We were taken to WEL lab and were given an experiment to perform.It was implementing 3 bit counter using a 4 bit counter  (not the usual kind but its easy.just that idea has to strike)and connecting it to a DAC circuit given in question and verifying with theoritical values.
**INTERVIEW :** There were 16 panels and we are alloted based on our preferences in the form filled earlier.Each panel had 2 members.If you are shortlisted for both institute as well as project(and dual degree (mtech +phd )also had interviews in same timings.You have to write same test as RA if u have applied and have been invited for that also),the panel asks you preference .I preferred project RA as i had interest in a proj 'chip design for Physiological monitoring(healthcare)' and had previous experience with my mini project in same area.I was asked to introduce myself and  I told about my education and projects I did as major and mini.They were interested and asked me about the circuit i used for mini project which had biasing,filtering and amplication.I was asked about the opamp used in my project and why was it specifically used(it was noiseless).We basically had a discussion rather than being interviewed.Then the professor asked me a basic RC filter question and asked me to draw outputs on R and C for a square wave input.Then asked when it would function as Integrator and differentiator and what happens if the case is opposite(RC>>T,RC<<T).All this took around 30 mins .Only one prof asked me all this.I got to know that other prof is asking about digital questions if we mentioned digital as interest.They asked me what I was doing for the last one year as i was already passout last year.Thats all.They said they were done.So simple it seems na ;).It was the simplest interview of all the ones i had.They were asking only basic questions.So if you have good gate score and performed reasonable well in written test and interview you can get seat easily.If you have less  gate score,dont worry but perform well in written test and interview.Results will be annouced in a week or two.
I am here by putting up few links that may be useful for students

### 8. IIT Delhi - Part 5 -  Interview Experiences

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-delhi-part-5-interview-experiences.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-delhi-part-5-interview-experiences.html)

### IIT Delhi - Part 5 - Interview Experiences
The results came out after 3 days.
Yes.  I tasted bitter in terms of loss of Texas and Cadence. But these were not un happy scenes for me because I knew how the things went inside in the interview.
But to my happiness finally, I got selected for VDTT - with the external sponsorship from Cypress Semi Conductors. Also, I got IEC.
Thank God..... So finally I got selected for something through rounds of interview..
Thanks..

The next post would be about the only Govt Job that I attended - BARC.
It is located in Bombay. It is one of the finest things. Although it is very good program but from the ECE point of view, all it would leave you is with a satisfaction that you are having Govt Job and nothing much.
Lets go to Bombay and taste some wada pav............................

### 9. IIT Delhi - Part 4 - Interview Experiences

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-delhi-part-4-interview-experiences.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-delhi-part-4-interview-experiences.html)

### IIT Delhi - Part 4 - Interview Experiences
I know many of you would be waiting as to what happened and how things went..
I was called for Cypress Semicondutors Interview
**Cypress Interview Experience:**
He asked me about hold time, set up time constraints and how they come into picture and what will you do to mitigate with it. Actually these questions would have been new to most of the Btech guys and even they were new to me also, had I not gone to IISC Bangalore.
They never asked these, but I got it here. So that's the reason, I would always ask people to attend interviews. Because you never know what happens when and what is coming your way.
It was followed up with some normal questions on comparators. I was asked to design a comparator using MOSFET.
Then few normal questions on CMOS Inverter. I was going well.
Then other questions about BJT. Few questions on Body Effect, different regions of operation of MOSFET and BJT.
Also the last question was "Why Mtech , leaving job in a company"
I some how felt very confident about the interview. I immediately called up my father and told that I would be in easily.

_**Cadence Interview**_
They had 2 panels - One for software and other for Analog profile. I some how, unable to recongize the labels of the panels, went to software profile. They asked C, Linked Lists, Data Structures.
I kept mum for a while and answered few things. But I never felt I was in.
They offered me a bottle of Yummy Apple Juice. I couldn't resist taking it, after all atleast Apple Juice should be for me, if not a position in Cadence.
**Texas Interview:**
I was shocked first of all as to how and why Texas called me because I kept them as 4 th preference. There was only 1 question that he was asking me since the starting. I and the person were discussing only about the same circuit. I could not solve to the extent to which he needed. It was again about transient analysis in Network Theory.
Then there were few questions on CMOS Inverter and the Body Effect. But they were too much beyond my capability.
**Qualcomm didn't call me.**

The second round i.e the sponsorship round, is it an elimination round or it is just to provide a sponsor to few student?

Yes it has elimination but not to the scale of the first round where there is major elimination
Out of the 30 students that nearly crossed the first round, only 8 got into the sponsorship.
So hope it makes sense.

Could you explain more about transient problem asked in Texas ?

### 10. IIT Delhi - Part 3 - Interview Experiences

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-delhi-part-3-interview-experiences.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-delhi-part-3-interview-experiences.html)

### IIT Delhi - Part 3 - Interview Experiences
So the day started with the continuation of the previous day.
VDTT is a sponsored program, where in the first round of Interviews will be conducted by the IIT Delhi Professors and the second round of interviews will be done the by Sponsors and the Internal MHRD Project Profs.
VDTT 2nd round:
So although, it was supposed to start @ 9 am in the morning, it started after lunch. So in the mean while, I went to IEC interview (skipping my lunch). To my luck, there were the few professors who interviewed me in VDTT first round. They recognized me and asked me whether I was through in the 1st round of VDTT. I replied kindly that the first round I got in and the next rounds are going on.
The Professors were impressed with my rank and also few questions normally about MOSFET were asked and I was told at that point of time only that you are offered IEC and if you don't fare well in VDTT next round, take it or else leave it fastly.
With the first success, I walked into VDTT interview room.
There were too many presentations.
**Companies :    Qualcomm, Texas, Cypress, Cadence.**
**Projects: Nanoscale Devices, Smart Cane/Refreshable** **Braille Display,Mass** **Spectrometer**
_**[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhURROTANe0yxH_Chga40jCcG_e4Uu_gYBRn6mxMhDwRfolGejam3BqmLEtmQdQ2Zw-0rLn0sE_lLyVnY1qtji7in2GmNq3WVWmX0danbvvtOfjAa8EihpDqC2KuoP6HBYI3OEawzXX0OI/s200/images.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhURROTANe0yxH_Chga40jCcG_e4Uu_gYBRn6mxMhDwRfolGejam3BqmLEtmQdQ2Zw-0rLn0sE_lLyVnY1qtji7in2GmNq3WVWmX0danbvvtOfjAa8EihpDqC2KuoP6HBYI3OEawzXX0OI/s1600/images.jpg)**_
So out of the 300 odd students that came into the initial phase, roughly 25 students were in for the next round and roughly 10 seats are available..
Lets fight...
We were asked to keep the preferences to the 7 Sponsors. I have kept Cypress in the top and followed with Cadence, Qualcomm, Texas.
Frankly I was afraid with Texas because of the previous experience in IIT Madras. At the same time, I was dis appointed that I was un prepared to attend the Interview of Qualcomm because I was not in touch with Communications for a while.
                In the next post, I will share my Interview. How things went. ..
                                                     How was the story of my failure agian... and a success story from it..

### 11. IIT Delhi - Part 2 - Interview Experiences

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-delhi-part-2-interview-experiences.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-delhi-part-2-interview-experiences.html)

### IIT Delhi - Part 2 - Interview Experiences
So I came to the room after the VDTT Interview and slept in the room without disturbing others who were having different interviews
I woke up @ 5 and along with 2 others went to the VDTT Office for the results @ 6pm on the same day. The results got delayed and it went on to 9pm finally. We waited out of curiosity and then you know what happened...
**I AM IN ......**
**[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSh9oyAne00PS4vfiwSfKm_6U_EFWn7jO8dkrjghfhk3EC-p8bwqBmP9dc5JMr5aovnxWpYekTc1XS0NxlRTCQR9oTskcbCHRM-eMQcouUL2u_BGdf069xrbHipH4dcxM-HJomAMbtibM/s1600/download.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSh9oyAne00PS4vfiwSfKm_6U_EFWn7jO8dkrjghfhk3EC-p8bwqBmP9dc5JMr5aovnxWpYekTc1XS0NxlRTCQR9oTskcbCHRM-eMQcouUL2u_BGdf069xrbHipH4dcxM-HJomAMbtibM/s1600/download.jpg)**
So after a lot of failures, I had some hope now.
I had two VLSI Interviews on hand the next day and Computer Technology Interview also.
I filled myself with all the inspiration. I thought to myself, yes this is moment may be for which I am waiting. I need to give my best.
I need to thank one of my friend's friend Kalyan Kota. He was helpful in making a lot of decisions.
So the day ended for many but it never ended for me because I was anxious, afraid, hopeful for a brighter tomorrow.
I read upto late night. - I always had only 2 books for my Electronics - Sedra & Smith and Razavi.
So the next day.
                                   Let me check it out..
Hope things go fine. - IEC / VDTT.
                                                              Please..

Hi,
I wanted to ask that how did you prepare for the interviews? From the questions that you've mentioned, it is nowhere near to the GATE syllabus. So, did you specially prepare for this?
Thanks.

I used to search in the internet about experiences and find out and talk with my friends of Mtech 1st year, about few things. Rest you can always prepare from standard text books.

### 12. IIT Delhi - Par1 - Interview Experiences

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-delhi-par1-interview-experiences.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-delhi-par1-interview-experiences.html)

### IIT Delhi - Par1 - Interview Experiences
Before going to Delhi, just 2 days back I got Kharagpur VLSI, so I was a bit uncertain whether I will be going because I was comfortable with VLSI in top 5 IITs. But then to my luck, the reservation was confirmed and I along with 2 others have gone there. From Hyderabad, it almost took 30 hours journey.
I had a lot of Interviews in IIT Delhi – IEC, VDTT, JTM, Computer Technology.
We got into the college 1 day before the Interview. IIT Delhi is good in one aspect that it doesn’t have written tests. I have not been qualifying the tests so far may be because they were written test  ( Jokes are excuses some times)
I have a friend Roopesh Sharma there ( JTM Student and AIR 245 in Gate 2014) . The hostels in IIT Delhi are not that great in terms of look. Food is ok. My friend had luckily made me familiar with few seniors of IEC and VDTT.
I had conversation with few persons of both IEC, VDTT. I came to know about the process but then I had to appear for the process.
**VDTT Interview :**
                            Initially they verified our documents and divided us into few groups and each group for each Interview panel. Mine was Panel 2. Initially every panel students were coming out but in our panel there was no one who even went inside. I was the first person as per sequence in my panel.
After a while, I was asked to come into. The Panel had 2 Professors, old enough to make me afraid. I greeted them and even they followed it up with a nice little smile, that made me feel a bit relaxed.
I was asked the following questions.
                                    1\. Draw CMOS Inverter
                                    2\. In the same diagram, now ground and power supply are exchanged?
                                     3\. Implement Y = AB+C+D (whole bar) in NMOS,PMOS,CMOS logics
                                       4\. If I add 2 sin signals with one of them having frequency f1 and other 2\*f1                                               or say some 1000\*f1. Then draw the resultant as a diagram.
                                            5\. Why CMOS. Why not NMOS or PMOS.
The results where supposed to be announced in the evening.
               I was waiting upto evening.

I was in an unknown status. Going by my heart, I thought I was in. But then Bangalore and Madras kept me thinking and reminding about my luck again and again...
**JTM Interview :**
                            Didn't attend the Interview because some how I was confident about VDTT and also even if I don't do VDTT well, I had IEC chance the next day. So, thought of preparing for them rather than going for JTM interview. Because any how even I had to go to Communications, I would go to IIT Bombay or Madras.
                        I will tell about the next part of VDTT in the next post.

### 13. IIT Madras - Interview Experiences

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-madras-interview-experiences.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-madras-interview-experiences.html)

### IIT Madras - Interview Experiences
Yes. After the failure of IISC Bangalore, I went to IIT Madras. I came here for Texas Sponsored MS.
It is one of the very good programs in IITs in the field of VLSI. IIT Madras is best for some one interested in Analog Research.  I was prepared for a tough fight.
I knew mentally that It would be very difficult for me to clear the rounds because the number of people whom they will call is all ECE Rankers < 1000 and all Instrumentation and Electrical guys with Ranks< 750.
**There is no reservation for this program. Luckily I haven't had any.**
I got there on May 1stitself. I had a friend Charan working in TCS. Both of us roamed around the city and went to sea shore and few other places. It was as if I came there for some other reason. But thanks to him, atleast roamed a lot in Chennai. Thanks for him for a lovely care.
Next day on May 2nd , I went to the College – IIT Madras. In the presentation by the Texas team, they have really made us get goose bumps for the company it is. It produces diverse products and today Texas is in the top position in Analog research and IIT Madras is like heaven for analog research.
It has 3 gods of Analog – Nagendra Krishnapura, Anirudhan, Shanti Pavan.  Texas came with an offer of employment of 16L after successful completion of MS, although nothing is assured. They will also give us higher stipend of 20K for the first year and 30K for the next 2 years.
I went to the written test. I was shocked to see the questions. They were not easy but neither were they out of box. I can assure you u can never come across such questions any where in any question bank.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzdHjpO8gybIyrJuQIsACoShFTmxxj7i8LC4KAiyJcGs0KnDAC6opr1qASO4oJgr-FWw9MRh-kRiTVYUjcz0RzgBSJlEgdBTd68I0GmcYaWMAnRU71KjVqBBMnVOH-GVNm1fOIGfgflmk/s200/things.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzdHjpO8gybIyrJuQIsACoShFTmxxj7i8LC4KAiyJcGs0KnDAC6opr1qASO4oJgr-FWw9MRh-kRiTVYUjcz0RzgBSJlEgdBTd68I0GmcYaWMAnRU71KjVqBBMnVOH-GVNm1fOIGfgflmk/s1600/things.jpg)
Most of the guys were in the same mood. Don't know what to comment. They were such questions which required us to be theoretically Mr. Perfect, nothing less.
I will update all the questions once I sit back to write all those in a notebook. In the mean while you can refer to the given link. Actually One thing is that Texas will only ask transient analysis and Analog Electronics to a very deep level.
[http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/vlsi/tiiprogram/faq](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/vlsi/tiiprogram/faq)
But this was a bit too tougher on my part. I knew that syllabus is Network theory and Analog Electronics. But I could not clear the written round due to my lack of understanding things in even perfect way.
It required a lot of mastery of the subject much better than mine.
But learnt again that I still need to improve.
               With low levels of Confidence and may be in a spot of bother whether I will not be able to manage to get VLSI seat through Interview, I read more for the next time...
                            Chalo Delhi. next

### 14. IISC - Interview Experiences

**Date:** 2015-06

### IISC - Interview Experiences
Hi Every one ..
So this is the post where in I will be sharing with all of you my CEDT written test experience.
Just like others, don't just have a negative opinion about IISC Bangalore that it has only research guys and no placements. It is very good institute and if you want to study peacefully, it is the best.
Be prepared for some good knowledge sharing during the two years of Mtech in IISC.
So the written test was scheduled on April 20th 2015, I arrived 1 day before. I have one friend there Satya Narayana who is studying there as CEDT student. He got 699 rank(OBC) last year ( When I got 751 Rank in General ).  Last year, I accompanied him to IISC because I had a call from Computation sciences with my last year rank. So due to this, It didn't take much of time for me to go to IISC after getting down at the Bus stop.
I will share few questions that I remember.
1\. How to make mux with de mux and vice versa.
2\. 5 to 8 questions on Embedded Systems ( Strange experience for most of the students )
3\. Simple Biasing question on BJT Transistor
4\. Simple question on Flip Flops and Micro Processor
5\. Question on Sub Threshold Region in MOSFET
6\.  Easy 2 questions in Mathematics
7\.  EM Theory about trasmission
8\. Design from 15V to 5V un regulated power supply
9\.  1 question on IPV4 and IPV6. It had one question also about router working.
10\. Little Endian and Big Endian question.
11\. Rise Time and fall time question and graph of output voltage vrs time when you have a capacitor and resistor connected in the output stage of a transistor
12\. Design a circuit for Chess board type of K-Map. Find the minimum number of xnor and xor gates.
I will keep on updating few other questions.. as and when I remember them or get it from few of my friends.... But mostly I have done it.
Some how after the Exam, I felt I would be in with 60% chance and 40% out.
               Unfortunately - the 40% came true.....
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWw9UyRcH1coKbbkDACVheSYJfJgvaq7W-Vrvnc0gLDulUX0A-ARXNiyMl1MRp2HXYEZxeMQgFI7gzDNYcIGMfy6hIPkNmVPShZQdAyrwUoQob3DS8JAoWvkHOK2x7fCr6J_jKr5qU_dc/s200/fail.jpeg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWw9UyRcH1coKbbkDACVheSYJfJgvaq7W-Vrvnc0gLDulUX0A-ARXNiyMl1MRp2HXYEZxeMQgFI7gzDNYcIGMfy6hIPkNmVPShZQdAyrwUoQob3DS8JAoWvkHOK2x7fCr6J_jKr5qU_dc/s1600/fail.jpeg)
So immediately took a train to Hyderabad and came back...
                     Next Journey is to the Ultimate Madras after 1 week gap...
                                                                                      Check it out next. .

### 16. GATE Preparation

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/gate-preparation.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/gate-preparation.html)

### GATE Preparation
Having posted all this stuff, the next responsibility would be from my end would be to put up the information about how I prepared for GATE and get a rank of 70 in Gate 2015 inspite of working in Infosys.
Although, I got AIR 751 in Gate 2014, sincerely I had put more efforts if not pain. But Gate 2015 was put more pain inside into.
I would put forth the links to the books to be downloaded shortly.
**1\. SemiConductor Physics - Prof. Karmalkar NPTEL Videos & Neamen**
            Read concepts well but mostly the formulae are very important in this subject. Be thorough with the proofs of each formulae because they may ask for different situations. This can happen only if u know the formulae derivation. Like in GATE they can ask u like what if the length is doubled then you tell what will be the current. If you just remember the formulae with constants, you will not be able to do so.
**2\. Micro Electronics - Sedra and Smith & Prof. Radha Krishnan Videos**
          Read concepts well and practise a lot of problems. Identify which regions of operation is BJT,MOSFET is in. I will add shortly few links of videos regarding JFET, which are helpful.
Formulaes regarding Pinch off is important because students often miss the poliarity and end up doing it wrong.
**3\. Electro Magnetic Theory - Prof. Shiv Goenkar Videos and Alexander Sadiku Book**
Often the most difficult subject. Yes it is but then if you have practised the solved problems of Alexander Sadiku Book, you will surely get goot understanding.
**4\. Control Systems - Ogata and Nagoorkani for Practise**
         It is the easiest subject and often the scoring subject. Understanding the 4 things - Polar Plot, Nyquist Plot, Bode Plot, Routh Hurth Criterio and their special cases is very important. Also the block diagram to Transfer function telling.
**5\. Signals and Systems - Openhiem**
This subject may seem to be difficult for few students initially but as and when you go on understanding Communications, you will be understanding thiings here in a better way. But read things well and often few direct questions from Openhiem will be given, that says the std of the text book it is
**6.** **Communications ( Analog and Digital ) - Taub and Schilling, B.P. Lathi and my friend Harish ( Mtech IIT Hyd pursuing)**
Difficult subject. But then you have to practise a lot of problems. Understanding about modulations schemes is not easy. You have spend some quality time and then you have to understand the things in a crystal clear way. Take a lot of time for this subject. Don't just run away with formulae
**7\. Engineering Mathematics - Few Videos in the You Tube and also few lecture notes**
    Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Calcilus, Approximations are the important things. Practise few problems. It will be easy.
**8\. Network Theory - Alexander Sadiku Network Analysis and few un covered topics from the net.**
           If you are done with the whole book of Alexander Sadiku, then you can assume you are done in all aspects apart from Graph Theory which is not there in this book. Practise few problems in Power anaylsis. Try to understand the difference between the real and apparent power.  Take units seriously. Power factor correction is often neglected by students. Transient analysis is very important. Try to solve few questions from the placements of Texas, because they are known to be the masters of Transient analysis.
**9\. Digital Electronics -  NPTEL Videos of  Prof Srinivasan and Marris Mano.**
Easiest subject may be if u understand and toughest if you don't. I would recommend local author book first like Anand Kumar and then practise questions from You tube and then later on read marris mano. Don' forget to read logic families. There will be few easy questions, why miss them.
Kanodia Practise Book was very helpful and I recommend you to solve it mostly for practise.
But there are many unnecessary questions in it and few wrong explanations. Don't mind them.

**Planning**
See, read upto November. Keep December for only practicing old question papers. Buy a hard copy book that consists of last 20 years papers. Solve each paper and see how much you are getting. Then understand the solution and see the topics again which you feel you are not comfortable.
Do it 3 times atleast so that it will be such a huge advantage that the moment you see a question from some topic then you will surely get an idea as to what or where in this question , will the questioning person will try to fool or trap us.
The next thing is to buy a test series that can be really useful for practicing.
For those who start preparing for gate after this. This should be your road map.
                  1\. Up to November - Prepare to the best and pratice as good as possible.
                   2\. December - Only test series and Old question Papers. Solve and Learn
                     3\. January - Revise and revist things. Don't learn new things. Perfection is important.
So, with this. I will go forward with the way the journey went on.
I am reminding you about my details
**Gate 2015 ECE Rank:   70**

    U can go to NPTEL and browse Dr. Radha Krishnarao ( KRK Rao) videos. Good to go through them for a thorough understanding of MOSFET and JFET required for GATE

    For GATE, U need to practise a lot too and with time bound and online calculator. So these things also come into picture and not only reading.
    All the best

    Previous years and kanodia will be sufficient if i practise them multiple times?

    See, if u do previous years papers and konodia, I won't say it would be sufficient, but it should be good enough for u have a go at GATE with confidence, but then remember that Text books are first option and on top of those, u have to rest. If u don't read proper text books, it doesn't matter what papers u do.

    If u believe that ur bad marks were due to ur lack of time for preparation. Then u should give some time and give a try.
    As long as u don't read proper text books, only coaching is not going to help u.
    So start reading text books and then parallelly do lot of practise and then try out exam.
    Good luck

    Sometimes, GATE can be bad exam, due to your lack of practise but if you have good basics, you can clear it in next attempt. So i suggest you to build good basics and I guess, I have scripted things nicely in the page. Read standard texts and NPTEL videos as prescibed. When ever you are done with a sem, try to practise gate questions on those completed subjects. U can get them in net and other sources. Practise parallely. Gives you better understanding. Hope it is fine.

### 17. MY GATE 2015

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/my-gate-2015.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/my-gate-2015.html)

### MY GATE 2015
Many people who are reading this blog might have asked themselves what is this person doing now??
So, having being frustrated with the work, I along with few other friends have started preparing for GATE. Four of us prepared and all four of us being from Infosys managed to prepare well and end up getting good ranks.
**Shivananda Rapolu – AIR 303 ( AIR 400 odd in Gate 2014 ) - Seat in IISC DESE now in 2015.**
**Sreenu Kakunuri – AIR 141 ( AIR 500 odd in Gate 2014) - Seat in Kgp VIPES now in 2015.**
**Mahendra Mundru – AIR 22 ( CSE )  ( AIR 300 odd in Gate 2014 ) - Seat in IIT Bombay in 2015.**
**Raghavapudi VNK Neeraj ( Myself ) - AIR 70 ( AIR 751 in Gate 2014)- Seat in IIT Delhi VDTT in 2015.**
You can claim that all of us have improved our ranks but then we had to write Gate again because we didn't knew many things like the Mtech RA of IIT bombay which is super for our ranks last year ones,
IIT Madras TI MS and regular MS in VLSI which are just awesome, IIT Delhi Computer Technology, JTM, JCA, Hyderabad RA and Direct Phd programmes in all IITs

| Don't take rest post gate. Travel a lot. Appear for a lot of Interviews... Run Run. Run.. |
But we all had to take the pain of writing GATE again while working .
My biggest gratitude to My Parents, who have been always with me and supporting me, My Philosopher, my guide - Mr. Sudhakar Reddy ( My college HOD ), All my friends and in specific  my buddy - Harish Kumar ( studying Mtech Communications in IIT hyd).
Without Harish, a lot would have not been possible. Thanks to him from the bottom of my heart.
By now, you would have got the reason why I blogged this information. I don’t want any one to miss things because he has no information regarding it.
Hope this helps....

Hi Ruchita,
Sorry for the late reply. But I was kind of reading upto Nov 15, rest I devoted completely for the Test series and trying to learn new things and unlearn my old mistakes. I guess, if you are confident on theory and are not too sure about the application of ur theory, then you should focus only on test series for atleast 1 month.
Good luck

### 18. The Unknown Mtech degrees ?

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-unknown-mtech-degrees.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-unknown-mtech-degrees.html)

### The Unknown Mtech degrees ?
1\. IIT Madras Regular and Texas M.S are very good and often people over look it. Don’t do it.
2\. IIT Delhi VDTT
3\. IIT Delhi JTM   and Computer Technology
**M.S. in India........**
          Its been few years that research is getting good boost up in India. M.S. is one of the prominent courses to have got started in IITs. Not all IITs over it. IIT madras, delhi, kgp offer M.S. All the three are good.
Though the degree is equal academically with Mtech, the duration will be round 1.5 to 2.5 yrs. It is more of research oriented and less of courses.  It is like MINI Phd. as one of my friend Karishma (M.S. @ IIT kgp) says
Don't compare Mtech and MS that IITs offer. Both are different courses meant for different purposes.
Admission is mainly based on written test and Interview. But GATE is mandatory
Shortly I will add a write up regarding MS in IITs and about research. It will be from my friend Karishma, pursuing her MS in IIT Kgp.
**Why not Direct PHD...**
Yes, many don't know about this. There is provision of direct PHD in India and few IITs have integrated course like the IIT Bombay which has Mtech+PHD course. Again Admission is mainly based on written test and Interview. But GATE is mandatory.

| Understand Yourself First before deciding whether to take research or conventional courses |
**M.S. vrs Mtech**
Both are good. MS is research oriented. If your research is in commercially viable areas, surely you will get placed in Companies in R&D sector. If not, you can go for Phd and plan for an academic career.
**Mtech  RA good or bad**
**Institute RA**
1. You will work in any one of the laboratories (System Admin lab, communications and DSP lab, microelectronics lab, power electronics and machines lab, electronic circuits lab) of the institute. Your work may be heavy or light depending on the lab you get.
2. You are free to choose your final year project and guide based on your interests.
3.For shortlisting for interview, 50% weightage is given to GATE score and 50% weightage to your marks in the written test
**Project RA**
1.You will be assigned  a particular project under a particular professor. This may be an institute sponsored project or a project sponsored
2.Gate Score weightage is 75%
3.You are not free to choose your final year project and guide
More information about IIT Bombay RA is given in the later posts where I have shared one of my friends' experience and I bet it is totally worth it reading.
As I said that there is no difference in the degree you get. All are same and it depends on you  as to how well you do.
**With this, I will end up telling you things and now start telling you things that made me get good rank in GATE 2015.**
**What all did I study?**
**How did I manage time inspite of working in a company?**
**What books did I study?**
**Come on explore more for all the secrets.**

### 19. The Others

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-others.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-others.html)

### The Others
**IIT Roorkee and Guwahati**
Both have only Mtech courses (TA).  They conduct counseling for their seats and few times interviews. They have VLSI, Communications, Signal Processing branches.
Check out with the seniors before you join them.
As it is counselling based. it is tought to estimate.
AIR< 300 ( General Category )   - VLSI
AIR< 450 ( General Category )  - Communication and Signal Processing.
**Newer IITs**
Of all the Newer IITs, only IIT Hyderabad is promising and is very super in terms of standards. This I am saying because of lot of reasons. I had done my Internship in IIT Hyderabad. It is very good in terms of research and placements and facilities, inspite of being a new IIT..
I have lot of friends who are studying and none of them have raised any negative point regarding it and all of them are getting into good companies.
**IIT Hyderabad**
It offers MTECH TA and RA, Direct Phd. Since 2015, It started Counseling for TA seats. Until 2014, it used to have direct admission for TA and Written test for RA.

1\. MTECH - TA
AIR< 250 ( General Category ) – VLSI
AIR < 500 ( General Category )  - Communication and Signal Processing
2 MTECH – RA
AIR < 1000 ( General Category ) will get call for written test and Interview
3 Direct Phd
AIR < 4000 (General Category )  - Call for Written test and Interview
Upto now, I have discussed maximum number of specializations of Post Graduation in IITs for ECE guys.
With this I will summarize this discussion and discuss a bit about other things.

### 21. IIT Delhi

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-delhi.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-delhi.html)

### IIT Delhi
_Often the second best place after IIT Bombay in terms of placements. It has lot of inter disciplinary courses and often ECE people find interest in here._
_Again IIT Delhi also offers Mtech ( TA Only no RA ), MS By research , Direct Phd.  The arguments and information about the latter two are same._
_IIT Delhi conducts written test/ Interview for all its branches. No direct admission. Often it has high weightage to Gate score._
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFTp3XcbjlTSBZODmYzEELdUjL0s8M45bHzS4z2i1ugsh4nuTReEAcMPaB1t4-gKCB7innKiDWRWW0Zr-k2n6SZxUWoO8AOaLwAzYN84bc7-UE8mz4ADnj_GvoYlNvIjrmVgTUDNFB76E/s200/delhi.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFTp3XcbjlTSBZODmYzEELdUjL0s8M45bHzS4z2i1ugsh4nuTReEAcMPaB1t4-gKCB7innKiDWRWW0Zr-k2n6SZxUWoO8AOaLwAzYN84bc7-UE8mz4ADnj_GvoYlNvIjrmVgTUDNFB76E/s1600/delhi.jpg)
_5.1  Mtech TA - Interviews_
_AIR< 80 ( General Category ) - IEC – Integrated Electronics and Ckts   Call for Interview_
_AIR < 150 ( General Category ) – Communications and Signal Processing_
_AIR < 900 ( General Category ) – Computer Technology ( No Gate score weightage here)_
_**5.1.1 Interdisciplinary Mtech Courses for ECE Guys :**_
_AIR < 300 ( General Category )  - JTM : Telecommunications and Management._
_AIR < 200 ( General Category )  - JVL – VDTT ( VLSI Design Tools and Technology)_
_JTM : It is communications branch which is very good in terms of placements in software industry._
_VDTT : It is a sponsored programme where in the first round of interviews are conducted by the IIT Faculty and the second round by the companies who have come up to sponsor you._
_It is best programme in India in terms of knowledge because it has industrial tie up and you will be getting a pre placement offer and also an opportunity to intern after your first year in their company. It has no Reservation._
_Computer Technology – Very good for those who want a software placement._
_5.2 MS by Research_
_In all allowed specializations_
_5.3. Direct Phd_
_In all allowed specializations_
_The advantage with IIT Delhi is that apart from the academics, it is the best place to be in for IAS and other Civils Coaching._
If you have any specific doubts regarding things, you can comment here and I will try to answer to the best of my knowledge regarding rank and other doubts.
_Next IIT is the one that was established the first._

Hi Jay
Good to listen that you are interested in Civil Services. There are many guys who come to IIT Delhi Mtech only for the coaching offered in Delhi. 1st year will be filled with courses for any specialization. 2nd year you can devote some time, by effectively planning between your Mtech thesis and your self goals. Almost all top branches will be having a busy schedule in the first year. So unless you take some ir relevant branches, I am not sure u will get time in 1st year.
Hope this clears it out. U can mail me - raghavapudi.neeraj@gmail.com if any.

Mtech in Enery studies is an interdisciplinary course and I guess it might suit you, since the little pressure of 1st year should be tolerable by you, since you have already seen IIT Btech. Go ahead with it or see some other branch. Make a wise choice so that you don't have to repent later. All the best

### 22. IIT Kanpur

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-kanpur.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-kanpur.html)

### IIT Kanpur
The best place to be in after IISC and IIT Madras for research is un doubtedly IIT Kanpur. It is very good.  They have only Mtech and recently MS has been started. But I am putting my information only regarding Mtech.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2w0cAzFlhB5Zh8KNf0lZqHOYvLIkpoW_z5ilv-3qSxFqrczR9XjgxIIGpIV6qB9QCbRLd124B1T0lRrC-2_r_L8UPosonZhuQs6yNvJAX7Cod8QE4a8qiexA5WgAqE_PQVY0i2deE7js/s320/kanpur.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2w0cAzFlhB5Zh8KNf0lZqHOYvLIkpoW_z5ilv-3qSxFqrczR9XjgxIIGpIV6qB9QCbRLd124B1T0lRrC-2_r_L8UPosonZhuQs6yNvJAX7Cod8QE4a8qiexA5WgAqE_PQVY0i2deE7js/s1600/kanpur.jpg)
IIT Kanpur has only 2 yr Mtech in VLSI ,Communications and RF. ( Apt and Useful to us)
From 2015, they also started MS, but I have very little information, I will update it soon since one of my friend ended up joining it and got placed recently in Dec 2016 in Intel !!!
They conduct interview/written test.  The number of seats are high on par with other IITs in each specialization. But the common myths are that the lower rankers like < 150 are not entertained there mostly because the management doesn’t want any one to leave their college  before completing their MTech for government job and waste a seat. So they ensure no one is there of that category. But this is common myth and need not be true.
AIR< 300 ( General Category )  - VLSI Call for Interview
AIR< 500 ( General Category )  - Communication Call for Interview
AIR < 700 ( General Category )  - RF Call for Interview
Since 2015, IIT Kanpur is starting MS also.  Check out once.
If you have any specific doubts regarding things, you can comment here and I will try to answer to the best of my knowledge regarding rank and other doubts.
Next IIT is our Capital City College. . I know. all know. it.

### 23. IIT Madras

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-madras.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-madras.html)

### IIT Madras
It is located in the wooden campus. It looks like a forest. One of the best places to be in for a quality research in VLSI.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfq6CvpK4zD_qEKF6Qm9ejR8W9hWxJuUePaaA07Iyj4e1Ho1nU3AgrofQ95eKC63uQ17LanXhTcpXL-4n2EY6bsHpT_mGrmWU2gWiO_fGLvrxb2ozVTDmEMA9rtgD7j7X7CXa54YbcRM0/s200/madras.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfq6CvpK4zD_qEKF6Qm9ejR8W9hWxJuUePaaA07Iyj4e1Ho1nU3AgrofQ95eKC63uQ17LanXhTcpXL-4n2EY6bsHpT_mGrmWU2gWiO_fGLvrxb2ozVTDmEMA9rtgD7j7X7CXa54YbcRM0/s1600/madras.jpg)
Remember that IIT Madras will be too late in announcing the results so as a result the analysis regarding it is very tough. But there is also less seats here on par with other IITs and also moreover they have spot admission. With this coming into picture, it makes a bit difficult to guess about the whereabouts of the analysis.
Still generally We can note the following things in general. Also there is no 3 yr Mtech – RA here. There is a MS by Research Programme. ( It is like MSc in IISC )
3.1 Mtech – 2 yr – TA – Direct Admission
           AIR<50 ( General Category )  - VLSI  ( If not in the first round, atleast in the later rounds)
          AIR < 100 ( General Category  ) – Communications.
3.2 MS By research. – Written and or Interview
1.NORMAL / REGULAR MS :  It has written test and approximately upto 2000 ranks in the open category are called for the written test and Interview process. No weightage to Gate score. It is not a time bound course and professor bound course. But MS in VLSI is highly required now a days.
2.TEXAS MS :  It is very good programme with the sponsorship coming from the Texas Company and an offer of employment with them post your MS. You will be paid minimum of 20K per month as stipend and also an opportunity with Texas as an Intern. The written test and Interview has strictly < 1000 rank in any category. There is no reservation.
**For more information : [http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/vlsi/research/start](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/vlsi/research/start)**
3.3 Direct Phd / Phd – Written Test and or Interview
This is again a research programme and Direct Phd is taken immediately after Btech and normal Phd is after your Masters.
If you have any specific doubts regarding things, you can comment here and I will try to answer to the best of my knowledge regarding rank and other doubts.
Next IIT is none other than the IIT known for the most packages in 2014.. Guesses come one.

### 24. IIT Bombay

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-bombay.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-bombay.html)

### IIT Bombay
Often called as home for placements, it is located in Powai. The best IIT for placements. It is very good in terms of the infrastructure and Industry tie ups.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjauZRVnfti_s_WDahml4TVRY0Bo8xQuFCT_gzTRAU61KjCdxFS1MkReFXYjCMCw75F46ucR2S4YF0oPw1afubjzBSe83zm15XptLDnwezaO5hPAegyYz6l0vaoP1BSXFFL5-bbcdfmW5Y/s200/IIT-Bombay-campus.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjauZRVnfti_s_WDahml4TVRY0Bo8xQuFCT_gzTRAU61KjCdxFS1MkReFXYjCMCw75F46ucR2S4YF0oPw1afubjzBSe83zm15XptLDnwezaO5hPAegyYz6l0vaoP1BSXFFL5-bbcdfmW5Y/s1600/IIT-Bombay-campus.jpg)
1.1Mtech – TA – Teaching Assistantship – 2 yr Program – Direct Admission
Specializations are 6 But I am telling only those that will land you in job or rather in one or other way related to ECE.
Micro Electronics, Electronic Systems, Communications Engineering.
1.2Mtech – RA – Research Assistanship – 3 yr Program – Written Test and Interview
It has same specializations as what Mtech TA has. The difference is that it is relaxed program because it has 1 extra year. But there are two types of RA – Project RA and Institute RA.
The job opportunities are same  for both RA and TA except that the RA guys spend 1 extra year in IIT Bombay.  But be prepared for some higher amount of work hours than the TA guys.
1.3Mtech + Phd – 5 yrs Minimum – Written Test and Interview
It has same specializations.
Getting an admission into TA is very tough because it has direct admission. RA and Phd program is much more relaxed. So higher rank guys can try for this.
AIR< 40 ( General Category )  -  TA Micro Electronics
AIR< 70 ( General Category )   - TA Electronic Systems
AIR< 90 ( General Category )   - TA Communication Systems
AIR < 700 ( General Category ) – Mtech + Phd Call Letter
AIR <  1000 ( General Category )  - RA Written Test Interview. The number of seats in RA category are not fixed and ad hoc. They are as per the needs of the Professors.
I have put up some information regarding the types of RA in the later parts.
If you have any specific doubts regarding things, you can comment here and I will try to answer to the best of my knowledge regarding rank and other doubts.

Hi Raveena. If u are a core analog student, who is very passionate about analog circuits, u should prefer Iit Madras MS. Bombay is good for digital and devices. Delhi is good in all. Iisc focuses more on embedded. Hope this helps..

### 25. IISC Bangalore

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iisc-bangalore.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iisc-bangalore.html)

### IISC Bangalore
**_IISC Bangalore_**
IISC closes its applications very fastly mostly 1 week after Gate Results. So Be aware.  Other IITs give you some time.  Be be prepared with all the necessary things like scanned copies of your Btech Marklists , Original Degree,  Photo, Signature. If you are that year pass out, then have Course Completion certificate. Remember that most of the Institutes will ask 60% Btech Percentage Minimum.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhICu7-q3YpRHarsHnUOmyMV2G_N5IWuKuGpdTjlvFzPMuxtpc5VggWVPWjyNqlBbHXtj9sNt1CYVUtFl-T6SkrfzikuycqkevaOuy-L9O3QBP8gV-Vzb63NuVUgcmSyewY19-uMxWCM_8/s200/IISc1.gif)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhICu7-q3YpRHarsHnUOmyMV2G_N5IWuKuGpdTjlvFzPMuxtpc5VggWVPWjyNqlBbHXtj9sNt1CYVUtFl-T6SkrfzikuycqkevaOuy-L9O3QBP8gV-Vzb63NuVUgcmSyewY19-uMxWCM_8/s1600/IISc1.gif)
Located in Bangalore and often called as the best place to be in for a peaceful study. If someone is interested in Research Programmes. This is a heaven. I am here by telling the programmes it offers.
1.1ME : Master of Engineering  - Direct Admission
Specialization :  Micro Electronics, Signal Processing,  Communications and Networks.
1.2.Mtech : Master of Technology
CEDT ( Centre of Electronics Design Technology). Now it is called as DESE ( Dept of Electronic System Engineering). Written Test and Interview.
1.3  MSc Engineering  - Written Test and or Interview
This is a research program and the duration will not be fixed and generally it takes 2 to 3 years. It can be opted by those who are interested in research.  But just remember that when you are in some prestigious institute, then you should not think much about placements and think only  about gaining as much knowledge as possible.
In placements they open for a Department and as long as you are in the same Electrical Department, you should not be much worried whether you are ME/MTECH/MSc. It is your knowledge levels that matter. But in MSc you should be prepared to do more research work rather than conventional course work unlike Mtech/M.E.
This is also one of the options.
1.4 Direct Phd / Phd – Written Test and or Interview
This is again a research programme and Direct Phd is taken immediately after Btech and normal Phd is after your Masters.
So getting an admission for ME Programmes is very tough because it is direct admission. So Gate ranks should be very low. But CEDT is a VLSI Programme and it is one of the best in India.  It has a written test followed by Interview. But the advantage here is that there is no weightage to Gate score or your previous stage performance in the evaluation of your next stage.
AIR< 20 ( General Category)  - ME  Micro Electronics.
AIR< 120 ( General Category)   - ME  Communications and Networks and ME Signal Processing.
AIR < 300 ( General Category )  - CEDT call letter you will get. Prepare well from Gate results. Contact those who are studying their First Year CEDT and get information about CEDT.
AIR>300 & AIR<1000 ( General Category )  - MSc Program and Direct Phd  call letter is for sure. So be prepared for it if you want to go for such programmes.
Remember for OBC you can assume 1.5 times and SC/ST 3 times atleast. But when you have category, better apply because it depends on the number of applicants ahead of you. The seats are reserved and if there is no one in your category then inspite of how large your rank is you will be getting it. So don't miss what you have.
If you have any specific doubts regarding things, you can comment here and I will try to answer to the best of my knowledge regarding rank and other doubts.
This is all about IISC programmes, that I wanted to put up.
                   Let us see the Bombay IIT in the next IIT.........

### 26. IIT Mtech or MS in Foreign

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-mtech-or-ms-in-foreign.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/iit-mtech-or-ms-in-foreign.html)

### IIT Mtech or MS in Foreign
Al though the above mentioned reasons are not the only but few among my mind.. Once you are stubborn that you want to pursue higher education, the next idea will be M.S. in Foreign Universities or M Tech in IITs?  ( I have not put any ideas regarding the Non Technical Education)
**Why M.S in Foreign Universities.  :**
If you have good family background and is someone who can fight out in odd environments, then you can try out this. But be stubborn that the amount is going to be high but then you can do some part time and other things to get back some time. The placements are good in many universities and you can end up easily with 40 to 50 Lakh Salary Jobs.
In Foreign PHD are paid scholarships easily on par with M.S. But for M.S. it is tough to get scholarship. Also develop some clarity as to why you are going for M.S. Is it because of your interest in Higher education and research or is it for better placement. Depending upon that you have to choose M.S. with Thesis or without thesis. Know about these things better.

**_Why M Tech in India :_**
Because if you think your family is not that good financially and you want to do it free of cost, then this is the best place. Join M tech and you will get some financial aid of 12400 Rs if Mtech and if Phd it will be 28000 Rs per month. So it is Risk free and moreover if you feel that you develop even more interest towards studies after doing your masters, then you can surely continue your education in same IIT as PHD scholar or also go to foreign university for your PHD. But the advantage will be that you will be paid scholarship for your PHD in Foreign Universities.. Or if you felt you have done enough by studying Mtech in IITs you can easily get placed in IITs or you can opt for lecturer jobs in any college even in the worst case.
If you decide upon IIT Mtech then you can carry on reading the blog. Because I have put the information only regarding it only.  Just to remind you that the information given below regarding Gate ranks is mostly about GATE ECE only. Although the above discussion that We had is applicable to any branch.
For those who feel they can take it up - go for MS or else Mtech in IITs is always a good and a stepping stone for a better career.
**So at this point of time, I know many would have thought about their careers. So few of your friends might have already started their dreams of enjoying in Foreign and few others would have started their dreams about IITs.**
**Let me put up the information about MTech in IITs - ( India First after all)**

### 27. Why higher education

**Date:** 2015-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/why-higher-education.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/06/why-higher-education.html)

### Why higher education
_1._ If you are one of the techie guys and is **passionate about doing some silly and funny  things with technology** – Go for Mtech in IITs
2\. Most of us study only in small colleges not known much for placements. So always a **higher degree** in top colleges will help you get better placed and better brand.
3\. **Passion towards Education** may be the reason for few. They needn't stop their education after Btech and start working in some companies too early.

_4_.In B Tech, most of students end up getting placed in companies like Infy, TCS, Wipro, CapGemini and few others which are bulk recruiters. I do agree that at that point, one would always get carried away and hence will not think about any other thing apart from the campus placements.
Remember that most of these companies only believe your analytic power and offer you employment. The package they pay you will be pretty low like 3 to 4 Lakh at max depending on which company you land up. You will be trained on something and finally you will be working on something which may or may not like it or know it rather. If you hate all these, then better go for higher education...............
5\. Want to work for **core Companies**........... of ECE. then go for higher educaiton...
6\. Often Post graduation is the stepping stone for one's career in research and high profile jobs.
7\. Last but never the least .... **.** **Higher package**….  in IITs.. Surely average package is 10 Lakhs
( Reminding you again that all this is for ECE guys. Because I know most of my CSE friends of Mtech will be earning  20s and 30s Lakhs on an average)
**So, having seen these points, I know there is a bit of confusion among the minds of many a students.**
**Few would have thought of MS in foreign and few would have thought of Mtech in IITs.**
**What to choose??**
**Why Mtech ? Why MS..**
**What are types of Mtech and MS**
**Is MS equivalent to Mtech in India?**
**Is MS the property of USA or is it present in India also??**
**Thinking right??**
**Carry on guys. there is lot more in t _he next post._**

### 28. How propagation of ‘X’ happens through different logic gates

**Date:** 2015-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/05/propagation-of-x.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/05/propagation-of-x.html)

### How propagation of ‘X’ happens through different logic gates
‘X’ refers to a
signal attaining a value that is ‘unknown’. It can be either ‘0’ or ‘1’. But,
the exact value of the signal is not known. If a simulator is not able to decide
whether a logic value should be logic ‘0’ or logic ‘1’, it will assign a value ‘X’
to the value. An example of ‘X’ source is a logic block that has not been
initialized properly through reset. Having an ‘X’ value at a
node can propagate to the logic lying in the fan-out, thereby increasing the
uncertainty downstream the logic.
**How ‘X’ propagates**: An ‘X’ value
at the input of a logic gate may or may not propagate to its output depending
upon the states at other inputs of the logic gate. Given below is how different
logic gates react to ‘X’ values:
1) **OR**
**gate**: An OR gate can absorb an ‘X’ if the other input has logic ‘1’.
Otherwise, ‘X’ propagates through it. Please refer figure 1 for explanation:
|     |
| [![A logic '1' at the other input saves 'X' from propagating through an OR gate, whereas a logic '0' causes 'X' at the other input to propagate to the output.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjimu9zjDm-XfnnJ20m9z1Hugus6FB3fo3SdUYiXjDfzP8nrR4HjuF0qN76F88COQMoQwlDhHqs8hIS29Gr-zeOi9YxlsKM1Bw5S2V6Xwd8Pd_kbhJnVv8HLNjzIENdBF2HFZZtyx4dOGfh/s640/x-propagation+through+OR+gate.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjimu9zjDm-XfnnJ20m9z1Hugus6FB3fo3SdUYiXjDfzP8nrR4HjuF0qN76F88COQMoQwlDhHqs8hIS29Gr-zeOi9YxlsKM1Bw5S2V6Xwd8Pd_kbhJnVv8HLNjzIENdBF2HFZZtyx4dOGfh/s1600/x-propagation+through+OR+gate.png) |
| **Figure 1: X-propagation through OR gate** |
**2) AND**
**gate**: An AND gate can absorb ‘X’ if the other input has logic ‘0’.
Otherwise, ‘X’ propagates through it. Please refer figure 2 for explanation:
|     |
| [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg0aEu1fYjyeavmfNOnoqPZEi61hkuehO0ZeQUYjdpk5db5a5rv5LKJkktPpqgKf6P5nMHtk37ruTNgGVO37eMPL_sS_C49Kemzxys8M9tKjablYYBxR2C9DnbhUrZ_1K6aN8EzfOZICTQv/s640/Picture8.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg0aEu1fYjyeavmfNOnoqPZEi61hkuehO0ZeQUYjdpk5db5a5rv5LKJkktPpqgKf6P5nMHtk37ruTNgGVO37eMPL_sS_C49Kemzxys8M9tKjablYYBxR2C9DnbhUrZ_1K6aN8EzfOZICTQv/s1600/Picture8.png) |
| **Figure 2: X-propagation through AND gate** |
**3) Buffer/inverter**:
Since, buffers/inverters are single input gates, an ‘X’ at the input means ‘X’
at the output.
4) XOR
gate: An ‘X’ at one of the inputs of XOR produces ‘X’ at the output no
matter what the
other input state is. Please refer truth table given in Figure 3 for explanation:
|     |
| [![An 'X' at the input of an XOR gate propagates to the output no matter what is the state of the other input.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRb7GXgEv3w2Vs7216mpEG-XuEpqC0U_6ftGjyKLIzK3F0oBjgRqCqM88jRVTGhqWPprtebfw7pDVpze1bKrzKaE5UDuEFa_F_zI4-XlpyveDkS64wloxKodTKpDlYqiJbrXVg_x_WxvVm/s640/x-propagation+through+XOR+gate.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRb7GXgEv3w2Vs7216mpEG-XuEpqC0U_6ftGjyKLIzK3F0oBjgRqCqM88jRVTGhqWPprtebfw7pDVpze1bKrzKaE5UDuEFa_F_zI4-XlpyveDkS64wloxKodTKpDlYqiJbrXVg_x_WxvVm/s1600/x-propagation+through+XOR+gate.png) |
| **Figure 3: X-propagation through XOR gate** |
**5) Complex**
**gates**: For complex gates, whether ‘X’ will propagate to the output
depends upon the overall function of the ‘X’ input with respect to other gates.
E.g. suppose a gate with function
**Z = A + (B \* C)**
Then, if B input
goes ‘X’, the output will go ‘X’ if A=0 and C=1.

Hi Pramod
The "X" we are referring here is different. It refers to an unknown value. Invert of an unknown value will be unknown only. I hope I make sense. We can discuss more, in case more clarity required.

2) AND gate: An AND gate can absorb ‘X’ if the other input has logic ‘0’. Otherwise, ‘X’ propagates through it. Please refer figure 2 for explanation: The figure indication here is wrong, am I correct?. Output put of AND where one end connect to 0 is 0
& output of AND that one input connected to 1 should propagate x

### 29. Can a net have negative propagation delay?

**Date:** 2015-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/04/can-net-have-negative-propagation-delay.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/04/can-net-have-negative-propagation-delay.html)

### Can a net have negative propagation delay?
As we discussed
in ‘’ [Is\\
it possible for a logic gate to have negative propagation delay](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2014/07/is-it-possible-for-logic-gate-to-have.html)”, a logic
cell can have negative propagation delay. However, the only condition we
mentioned was that the transition at the output pin should be improved drastically
so that 50% level at output is reached before 50% level of input waveform.
In other words,
the only condition for negative delay is to have improvement in slew. As we
know, a net has only passive parasitic in the form of parasitic resistances and
capacitances. Passive elements can only degrade the transition as they cannot
provide energy (assuming no crosstalk); rather can only dissipate it. In other words, it is not
possible for a net to have negative propagation delay.
However, we can have negative delay for a net, if there is crosstalk, as crosstalk can improve the transition on a net. In other words, in the presence of crosstalk, we can have 50% level at output reached before 50% level at input; hence, negative propagation delay of a net.

### 30. Temperature inversion – concept and phenomenon

**Date:** 2015-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/04/temperature-inversion-deep-dive-into.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/04/temperature-inversion-deep-dive-into.html)

### Temperature inversion – concept and phenomenon
To understand the phenomenon of temperature inversion, let us first understand the concepts governing the conductivity of semiconductor devices with respect to changes in temperature.
**Phenomenon governing semoconductor conductivity vs. temperature**: In all, there are two phenomenon
that govern the conductivity in any device-
- **Carrier**
**concentration**: Electrons and holes are the charge carriers in a semiconductor. More is the number of carriers; greater is the conductivity
of the material. Rise in temperature causes greater number of bonds to break due to higher number of collisions among vibrating molecules; thus, resulting in higher number of carriers with increase in temperature. This factor tends
to increase the conductivity with increasing temperature. More the number of carriers, greater is the conductivity.
- **Mobility**
**of the carriers**: Mobility is another measure of conductivity. Greater is the mobility of carriers, carriers move with greater speed, thus, contributing more to the overall current; hence, greater is the
conductivity of the material. With increase in temperature, lattice vibrations
increase resulting in less mobility of free carriers. So, this factor tends to
decrease the conductivity with temperature increase.
Summing up, the
trend of conductivity with temperature depends upon which of the above two
factors dominates. Based upon the conductivity, the materials can be divided
into three types - conductors, insulators and semi-conductors. Let us explore
how the conductivity of these materials is based on the above two factors:
**Conductivity of conductors (metals)**:
Metals have abundance of loosely attached nearly free electrons (as is commonly
called, the electron sea), the carriers of electric current. The increase in carrier
concentration is ignorable with change in temperature. So, mobility factor
dominates. The conductivity of conductors decreases with increase in
temperature.
**Conductivity of insulators (non-metals)**:
Insulators have almost negligible free carriers. The electrons in insulators are
tightly bound to atoms by bonds. The conductivity is negligible in insulators
due to limited number of carriers. However, the number of free carriers
increases exponentially with temperature. This increase in carrier
concentration with temperature outpaces the decrease in mobility thereby making
the insulators to gain conductivity with rise in temperature. So, the conductivity in insulators increases with rise in temperature.
**Conductivity trend in Semiconductors**: Semiconductors
have conductivity in-between metals and insulators. These are the class of
insulating materials in which electrons are loosely bound to atoms. A small
energy is needed to break these bonds and supply free carriers, which can be
supplied by potential difference applied across the semiconductor, or, by
temperature itself, in the form of thermal energy. So, there can be any of the
two factors dominating depending upon the voltage applied across the
semiconductor. The decrease or increase in conductivity of semiconductor depends upon which of the two factors dominates. For CMOS transistors, the number of charge carriers directly
translates to threshold voltage.
At high voltage
levels applied, there is abundance of free charge carriers as a result of the energy
supplied by the potential difference created. At this state, there is not
significant change in carrier concentration with increase in temperature; so,
the mobility factor dominates; thereby, decreasing the conductivity with
temperature. In other words, at high levels of voltages applied, the conductivity of semiconductors decreases with temperature.
Similarly, in the absence
of any voltage applied, or with little voltage applied, the semiconductor
behaves similar to an insulator with very less number of carriers, those
resulting from only thermal energy. So, increase in carrier concentration is
the dominating factor. So, we can say that at low applied voltages, the
conductivity of semiconductors increases with temperature.
**The concept of temperature inversion**: With reference to the discussion we had earlier, at higher technology nodes, the voltage levels used to be high. So,
traditionally, the delay of CMOS logic circuits used to increase with
temperature. So, the most timing critical corner used to be worst process,
minimum voltage and maximum temperature. However, with scaling down of
technology, the voltage levels have also scaled down. Due to this, at
sub-nanometer technology levels, both the factors come into play. At lower
range of the operating voltage levels, first factor comes into play. In other
words, at lower technology nodes, the most setup timing critical corner has
become worst process, minimum voltage and minimum temperature. This shift in
setup critical corner, in VLSI jargon, is termed as temperature inversion.

### 31. Can hold check be frequency dependant?

**Date:** 2015-04
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/04/can-hold-be-frequency-dependant.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/04/can-hold-be-frequency-dependant.html)

### Can hold check be frequency dependant?
We often
encounter people argue that hold check is frequency independent. However, it is
only partially true. This condition is true only for zero-cycle hold checks. By
zero cycle hold checks, we mean that the hold check is performed on the same
edge at which it is launched. This is true in case of timing paths between same
polarity registers; e.g. between positive edge-triggered flops. Figure 1 below
shows timing checks for a data-path launched from a positive edge-triggered
flip-flop and captured at a positive edge-triggered flip-flop. The hold timing,
in this case, is checked at the same edge at which data is launched. Changing
the clock frequency will not cause hold check to change.
|     |

| **Figure**<br>**1: Setup and hold checks for**<br>**positive edge-triggered to positive edge-triggered flip-flop** |
Most of the
cases in today’s designs are of this type only. The exceptions to zero cycle
hold check are not too many. There are hold checks for previous edge also.
However, these are very relaxed as compared to zero cycle hold check. Hence,
are not mentioned. Also, hold checks on next edge are impossible to be met
considering cross-corner delay variations. So, seldom do we hear that hold
check is frequency dependant. Let us talk of different scenarios of frequency
dependant hold checks:
1. **From**
**positive edge-triggered flip-flop to negative edge-triggered flip-flop and**
**vice-versa**: Figure 2 below shows the setup and hold checks for a timing
path from positive edge-triggered flip-flop to a negative edge-triggered
flip-flop. Change in frequency will change the distance between the two
adjacent edges; hence, hold check will change. The equation for hold timing
will be given for below case as:
**Tdata \+ Tclk/2**
**\> Tskew \+ Thold**
**or**
**Tslack =  Tclk/2 - Thold \- Tskew**
**\+ Tdata**
          Thus, clock period comes into
picture in calculation of hold timing slack.
|     |
| [![Both setup and hold checks are half cycle. Setup is checked on next edge whereas hold is checked on previous edge](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg32cIMeKBx5PW-pTCIuNZ32T3JGdvpfLNeFviKjj3sL1ctQ6eZT0Wztdb5ipJhdZ60izxW6lzzzKBXvW4CC-MlH3cU6O-sPp8Nj-bXcwvf4dA-NdqC5muzZ-wKAw6phrl7elYh3iELwuZT/s1600/positive+flop+to+negative+flop+setup+and+hold+checks.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg32cIMeKBx5PW-pTCIuNZ32T3JGdvpfLNeFviKjj3sL1ctQ6eZT0Wztdb5ipJhdZ60izxW6lzzzKBXvW4CC-MlH3cU6O-sPp8Nj-bXcwvf4dA-NdqC5muzZ-wKAw6phrl7elYh3iELwuZT/s1600/positive+flop+to+negative+flop+setup+and+hold+checks.png) |
| **Figure 2: Setup and hold checks for timing path from positive edge-triggered flip-flop to negative edge-triggered flip-flop** |
Similarly,
for timing paths launching from negative edge-triggered flip-flop and being
captured at positive edge-triggered flip-flop, clock period comes into picture.
However, this check is very relaxed most of the times. It is evident from above
equation that for hold slack to be negative, the skew between launch and
capture clocks should be greater than half clock cycle which is very rare
scenario to occur. Even at 2 GHz frequency (Tclk = 500 ps), skew has
to be greater than 250 ps which is still very rare.
Coming
to latches, hold check from a positive level-sensitive latch to negative
edge-triggered flip-flop is half cycle. Similarly, hold check from a negative
level-sensitive latch to positive edge-triggered flip-flop is half cycle. Hence, hold check in both of these cases is frequency dependant.
2. Clock
gating hold checks: When data launched from a negative edge-triggered
flip-flop gates a clock on an OR gate, hold is checked on next positive edge to
the edge at which data is launched as shown in figure 3, which is frequency
dependant.

| **Figure 3: Clock gating hold check between data launched from a negative edge-triggered flip-flop and and clock at an OR gate** |
           Similarly,
data launched from positive edge-triggered and gating clock on an AND gate form
half cycle hold. However, this kind of check is not possible to meet under
normal scenarios considering cross-corner variations.
3) **Non-default**
**hold checks**: Sometimes, due to architectural requirements (e.g.
multi-cycle paths for hold), hold check is non-zero cycle even for positive
edge-triggered to positive edge-triggered paths as shown in figure 4 below.

Nice explanation but please correct fig 4. In non-default hold checks, it says " positive edge-triggered to positive edge-triggered paths as shown in figure 4 below" but figure has negative edge triggered flop at capture.

Great explanation!!
2\. Clock gating hold checks
Though our focus is on non-zero Hold paths, I just wanted to add below details:
Negative-edge flop --> AND:
Setup - half cycle, Hold - 0 cycle
Postive-edge flop --> OR:
Setup - Half cycle, Hold - 0 cycle

### C function that converts hexadecimal value to decimal value.
Hexadecimal to decimal conversion is something that is often needed in hardware. Below functions can be used for hexadecimal to decimal conversion in C:
> #include<stdio.h>#include<conio.h>#include<string.h>
>
> **int get\_value(char a)**  {if(a>='0'&& a<='9' ){return (a- '0');}else if(a>='A' && a<='F')return ((a-'0')-7); } else if(a>='a' && a<='f')return ((a-'0')-39);elsereturn -1;
>
> }
> **int htoi(char a\[\])**{int len=strlen(a);int temp=0;for(int i=0;i<len;i++){int digit=get\_value(a\[i\]);if(digit == -1){return -1;}temp=temp\*16+digit;}return temp;}
>

### 2. Interesting programming quiz : Array Bound Read Error

**Date:** 2014-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/12/interesting-programming-quiz-array.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/12/interesting-programming-quiz-array.html)

### Interesting programming quiz : Array Bound Read Error
**Problem: Can you figure out what is wrong with following piece of code?**
> #include <iostream>int main() {int a\[5\] = {1,2,3,4,5};for (int i = 4; a\[i\] >= 0 && i >=0 ; i--) {std::cout<< "ith element of array is "<<a\[i\]<<std::endl;     }}
I would suggest you to  try it yourself before scrolling down to see the answer. Its quite interesting,

**Answer :** Here, as one can figure out, the intention is to print array elements from end till we don't hit any negative number. In the first look it may seem fine but unfortunately it will end up in **ABR (Array Bound Read)**.
**Explanation :** After the completion of 5th iteration; i.e. when **i = 0,** compiler will decrement **i;**  i.e., **i** will become "-1". It will, then, try to check the condition, which will result in reading **a\[-1\]**. Since, array can have indexes only greater than or equal to 0, it will result in an error. Trying to read array elements out of the allowed indexes is termed as **Array Bound Read Error**. Hence, one should avoid such conditions because it can result into random result. The program can crash anytime. If you are lucky, it may run successfully also. Its all up to your luck.  Instead, it should be
> for (int i = 5; i>=0 && a\[i\]  >= 0 ; i--) {
i.e. first check index value and then do the array access operation.
Here, with the above solution, one more interesting thing comes up to understand. In AND (&&) operation compiler first evaluates  _condition1;_ if it is true, then goes to evaluate _condition2;_ otherwise return _false_ from there only.
For example,
> #include <iostream>
>
> int main() {int i = 0;int j= 1;if(  ( i == 1) && (++j ==3)  ) {      std::cout<<"inside if"<<std::endl;}std::cout<<"i is "<<i<<" and j is "<<j<<std::endl;}
**Output :**
> i is 0 and j is 1
Here, as you can see code control will not go into **_if_** branch as none of condition is true. since _condition1_ **i==1** is false, compiler will not even check _condition2_ i.e. value of j will not be incremented.
Internally,  compiler might be doing some following kind of transformation to evaluate **_&&_** operation
> bool cond = (i==1);  if( cond ) {      cond = (++j != 0) ;  }if(cond){      std::cout<<"inside if"<<std::endl;}

### 3. Function Overloading

**Date:** 2014-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/12/function-overloading.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/12/function-overloading.html)

### Function Overloading
## Function overloading is a feature inherent in many programming languages including c++. It allows a user to write multiple functions with **same name** but with **different signatures**. On calling the function, the version of the function corresponding to the signature will be referred to. Function signature includes function parameters/arguments, but it does not include return type. Function signature may differ in terms of number of parameters or type of parameters. Let us illustrate with the help of a few examples:        **Example 1**: The two functions below are overloaded, since the return type of arguments differ:      > int func(int a,int b);double func(double a,double b);      Example 2: The two functions below are overloaded because they differ in the number of arguments:      > int func(int a,int b);int func(int a,int b,int c);      **Example 3**: The two functions below are not overloaded because they differ only in terms of their return type; the number and type of all the arguments is same.      > void func(int a,int b,int c);int func(int a,int b,int c);            Please note that C does not support function overloading because there is no concept of name mangling in C. On the other hand, C++ does support function overloading as name mangling is supported in C++. Name mangling is mangled name of function name and its signature which is used by C++ compiler internally to refer to functions. For instance, in above example 1, mangled name of functions will look something like shown below:        > func\_\_int\_intfunc\_\_double\_double        This way C++ compiler can handle function overloading.           **Note :** above are not the actual mangled names. Compiler can make some more complicated names. this is just for understanding.           Also read:

### 4. On-chip variations – the STA takeaway

**Date:** 2014-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/12/on-chip-variations-sta.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/12/on-chip-variations-sta.html)

### On-chip variations – the STA takeaway
Static
timing analysis of a design is performed to estimate its working frequency
after the design has been fabricated. Nominal delays of the logic gates as per
characterization are calculated and some pessimism is applied above that to see
if there will be any setup and/or hold violation at the target frequency.
However, all the transistors manufactured are not alike. Also, not all the
transistors receive the same voltage and are at same temperature.  The characterized delay is just the delay of
which there is maximum probability. The delay variation of a typical sample of
transistors on silicon follows the curve as shown in figure 1. As is shown,
most of the transistors have nominal characteristics. Typically, timing signoff
is carried out with some margin. By doing this, the designer is trying to
ensure that more number of transistors are covered. There is direct
relationship between the margin and yield. Greater the margin taken, larger is
the yield. However, after a certain point, there is not much increase in yield
by increasing margins. In that case, it adds more cost to the designer than it
saves by increase in yield. Therefore, margins should be applied so as to give
maximum profits.

However, probabilty of having that delay decreases as delay gets far from nominal.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcYx-uNsB-WFKa9pl6xizmobej2n050LcGs9NF-jPzZBNt7oCNNVJ8CA1FKaGJ1FMPde4z5_wBs2eyTKMuAj6BjUR96Q9q5DM8lqhpkPkQlPXjnrWTKLHysBl_aFrWaIaeMPnrgNz3Fb7R/s1600/OCV.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcYx-uNsB-WFKa9pl6xizmobej2n050LcGs9NF-jPzZBNt7oCNNVJ8CA1FKaGJ1FMPde4z5_wBs2eyTKMuAj6BjUR96Q9q5DM8lqhpkPkQlPXjnrWTKLHysBl_aFrWaIaeMPnrgNz3Fb7R/s1600/OCV.png) |
| **Number of transistors v/s delay for a typical silicon transistors sample** |
We
have discussed above how variations in characteristics of transistors are taken
care of in STA. These variations in transistors’ characteristics as
fabricated on silicon are known as OCV (On-Chip Variations). The reason for
OCV, as discussed above also, is that all transistors on-chip are not alike in
geometry, in their surroundings, and position with respect to power supply. The
variations are mainly caused by three factors:
- **Process**
**variations**: The process of fabrication includes diffusion, drawing out of
metal wires, gate drawing etc. The diffusion density is not uniform throughout
wafer. Also, the width of metal wire is not constant. Let us say, the width is
1um +- 20 nm. So, the metal delays are bound to be within a range rather than a
single value. Similarly, diffusion regions for all transistors will not have
exactly same diffusion concentrations. So, all transistors are expected to have
somewhat different characteristics.
- **Voltage**
**variation**: Power is distributed to all transistors on the chip with the help
of a power grid. The power grid has its own resistance and capacitance. So,
there is voltage drop along the power grid. Those transistors situated close to
power source (or those having lesser resistive paths from power source) receive
larger voltage as compared to other transistors. That is why, there is variation
seen across transistors for delay.
- **Temperature**
**variation**: Similarly, all the transistors on the same chip cannot have same
temperature. So, there are variations in characteristics due to variation in
temperatures across the chip.
**How to take care of OCV**: To
tackle OCV, the STA for the design is closed with some margins. There are
various margining methodologies available. One of these is applying a flat
margin over whole design. However, this is over pessimistic since some cells
may be more prone to variations than others. Another approach is applying cell
based margins based on silicon data as what cells are more prone to variations.
There also exist methodologies based on different theories e.g. location based
margins and statistically calculated margins. As advances are happening in STA,
more accurate and faster discoveries are coming into existence.

### 5. Latency and throughput – the two measures of system performance

**Date:** 2014-11
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/11/latency-and-throughput.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/11/latency-and-throughput.html)

### Latency and throughput – the two measures of system performance
Performance of the system is one
of the most stringent criteria for its success. While performance increases the
desirability among customers, cost is what makes it affordable. This is the
reason why system designers aim for maximum performance with available
resources such as power and area constraints. There are two related parameters
that determine the performance output of a system –
**Throughput** \- Throughput
is a measure of the productivity of the system. In electronic/communication
systems, throughput refers to rate at which output data is produced. Higher the
throughput, more productive is the system. In most of the cases, it is measured
as time difference between two consecutive outputs (nth and n+1th). Throughput
also refers to the rate at which input data can be applied to system.
Let us
discuss with the help of an example:
|     |
| [![throughput summary diagram](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXT5ZbZ9uxc4BNYtN1Sdeyz_aOheV9pufefAfr1b7PIGw405iSEc8N2hfFPJP51DoTwUYg9EZpmmS7g_Ztk6dF6d514mqRy8K-AmuzZxKA1bIP3p2HbdEJmsZyWdhjZoSjxiiPFw_N-B0w/s1600/throughput.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXT5ZbZ9uxc4BNYtN1Sdeyz_aOheV9pufefAfr1b7PIGw405iSEc8N2hfFPJP51DoTwUYg9EZpmmS7g_Ztk6dF6d514mqRy8K-AmuzZxKA1bIP3p2HbdEJmsZyWdhjZoSjxiiPFw_N-B0w/s1600/throughput.png) |
|  |
Above figure
depicts the throughput of 3 number adder. Result of input set applied at 1st
clock cycle appears at output at 3rd clock cycle and in 4th clock cycle next
input set is applied and output comes in 6th clock cycle.  Hence,
throughput of above design is ⅓ per clock cycle. As we can see from diagram,
first input is applied in first clock cycle and 2nd input is applied in 4th
clock cycle. Hence we can also say that throughput is rate at which input data
can be applied to system.
**Latency**\- Latency is the
time taken by a system to produce output after input is applied. It is a
measure of delay response of a design. Higher the latency value, slower is the
system. in synchronous designs, it is measured in terms of number of clock
cycles. In combinational designs, latency is basically propagation delay of
circuit. In non pipelined designs, latency improvement is major area of
concern. In more general terms, it is time difference between output and input
time.
[![Latency](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgYeSyWxy_lYKOcO0iA7OBvXU2zQHxxJpVXzZOHQMiIggtKIdA11VY9R-RycDdA8lLCFf4zOBKMBDEIMROntN6DZa0uTeMbCucHp2jbE0O9Wy5zrJPCOis2YEZ2IabF-AWixo5E6VMjwFzE/s1600/latency.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgYeSyWxy_lYKOcO0iA7OBvXU2zQHxxJpVXzZOHQMiIggtKIdA11VY9R-RycDdA8lLCFf4zOBKMBDEIMROntN6DZa0uTeMbCucHp2jbE0O9Wy5zrJPCOis2YEZ2IabF-AWixo5E6VMjwFzE/s1600/latency.png)
**Relationship between throughput and latency:** Both latency and throughput
are inter-related. It is desired to have maximum throughput and minimum
latency. Increasing latency and/or throughput might make the system costly. Let
us take an example. Consider a park with 3 rides and it takes 5 minutes for a
ride.  A child can take sequentially these rides; i.e, ride 1, ride 2 and
then ride 3. Firstly, let us assume that only one child at a time is allowed to
enter park at a time. While he is taking a ride, no one is allowed to enter the
park. Thus, the throughput of the park is 15 minutes per child and latency is
15 minutes. Now, let us assume that while a child has finished taking ride1,
another child is allowed to enter park. Thus, in this case, throughput will be
5 minutes per child whereas latency is still 15 minutes. Thus, we have
increased the throughput of the system without affecting latency and at the
same cost.

### 6. What is Logic Built-in Self Test (LBIST)

**Date:** 2014-11

### What is Logic Built-in Self Test (LBIST)
LBIST stands for
Logic Built-In Self Test. As VLSI marches to deep sub-micron technologies,
LBIST is gaining importance due to the unique advantages it provides. LBIST
refers to a self-test mechanism for testing random logic. The logic can be
tested with no intervention from the outside world. In other words, a piece of
hardware and/or software is inbuilt into an integrated circuit to test itself. By
random logic, is meant any form of hardware (logic gates, memories etc.) that
can form a part or whole of the chip. A generic LBIST system is implemented
using STUMPS (Self-Test Using MISR and PRPG) architecture. A typical LBIST
system is as shown in the figure below:

| **Figure**<br>**1: A typical LBIST system** |
**Components of an LBIST system**: A typical LBIST
system comprises following:
1. **Logic to**
**be tested, or, as is called Circuit Under Test (CUT)**: In case of LBIST, the
logic to be tested through LBIST is the Circuit under Test (CUT). Any random
logic residing on the chip can be brought under LBIST following a certain
procedure.
2. **PRPG**
**(Pseudo-Random Pattern Generator)**: A PRPG generates input patterns that are
applied to internal scan chains of the CUT for LBIST testing. In other words,
PRPG acts as a Test Pattern Generator (TPG) for LBIST. A PRPG can either use a
counter or an LFSR for pattern generation.
3. **MISR**
**(Multi-Input Signature Register)**: MISR obtains the response of the device
to the test patterns applied. An incorrect MISR output indicates a defect in
the CUT. In classical language, MISR acts as a ORA (Output Response Analyzer)
for LBIST testing.
4. **A master**
**(LBIST controller)**: The controller controls the functioning of the LBIST;
i.e. clocks propagation, initialization and scan patterns flow in and out of
the LBIST scan chains.
One of the most
stringent requirements in LBIST testing is the prohibition of X-sources. There
cannot be any source of ‘X’ during LBIST testing. By ‘X’, is meant a definite,
but unknown value. It might be either ‘0’ or ‘1’, but it is not known what
value is being propagated. All X-sources are masked and a known value is
allowed to be propagated in LBIST.
**Why ‘X’ is prohibited in LBIST**: As
stated above, there cannot be any ‘X’ propagating during LBIST testing. The
reason behind this is that LBIST involves MISR to calculate the signature of
the LBIST patterns. Since, the resulting signal is unique, any unknown value
can result in the corruption of the signature. So, there cannot be any ‘X’ in
LBIST testing.
**Advantages of LBIST**: As stated
above, there are many unique advantages of LBIST that make it desirable,
especially in safety critical designs such as those used in automobiles and
aeroplanes. LBIST offers many advantages as listed below:
- LBIST provides self-test capability to logic
inside chip; thus, the chip can test itself without any external control and
interference.
- This provides the ability to be tested at higher
frequencies reducing test time considerably.
- LBIST can run while the chip is on field running
functionally. Thus, it is very useful in safety critical applications wherein
faults developed on field can be easily detectable at startup before chip goes
into functional mode.
**Overheads due to LBIST**: Along
with many advantages, there are some overheads due to LBIST as mentioned below:
(i)The LBIST implementation involves some hardware
on-chip to control LBIST. So, there are area and power impacts due to these. In
other words, the cost of chip increases.
(ii)Also, ‘X’-masking involves addition of extra
logic gates in already timing critical functional signals causing impact on
timing as well.
(iii)Another disadvantage of using LBIST is that even
the on-chip test equipment may fail. This is not the problem with testing using
outside equipment with proven test circuitry

### 7. Worst Slew Propagation

**Date:** 2014-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/08/worst-slew-propagation.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/08/worst-slew-propagation.html)

### Worst Slew Propagation
Worst slew
propagation is a phenomenon in Static Timing Analysis. According to it, the
worst of the slews at the input pin of a gate is propagated to its output. As
we know, the output slew of a logic cell is a function of its input slew and
output load. For a multi-input logic gate, the output slew should be different
for the timing paths through its different input pins. However, this is not the
case. This is due to the reason that to maintain a timing grapth, each node in the design can have only 1 slew. So, to cover the worst scenario for setup timing, the maximum slew at each output pin should be equal to that caused by the input pin having worst of the slews. The output slew calculated is on the basis of worst input slew, even if
the timing path for which the output slew is being calculated is not through
the input pin with worst slew. Similarly, the best of the slews is calculated based upon the effect of all the input pins for hold timing analysis. We can refer to it as **best slew propagation**.
Let us
illustrate with the help of a 2-input AND gate. As shown in figure below, let the
slews at the input pins be denoted as SLEW\_A and SLEW\_B and that at the output
pin as SLEW\_OUT. Now, as we know:
SLEW\_OUT
= func (SLEW\_A) if A toggles leading to OUT toggling
And
SLEW\_OUT = func (SLEW\_B) if B toggles leading to OUT toggling
However, even though the timing
path as shown through A pin, the resultant slew at output SLEW\_OUT will be
calculated as:
SLEW\_OUT         =  func (SLEW\_A) if func(SLEW\_A) > func(SLEW\_B)
                                =  func (SLEW\_B) if func(SLEW\_B) > func(SLEW\_A)
|     |
| [![Worst slew propagation is carried out through the worst of all the slews caused by each input pin](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJm9BmCKhFDLqYHCqCud9Ul_nI6eMquqxhkMXlwu07Nnd7CWGb-08gED6v5-9k_XxTlddgsUHBZw7Gy0dZNaCLTq43TzbylmOJOxGZC3YOZaol-7A4Sbqe_LnjNjJ-fJWiug7hcIPVxv1X/s1600/worst_slew_propagation.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJm9BmCKhFDLqYHCqCud9Ul_nI6eMquqxhkMXlwu07Nnd7CWGb-08gED6v5-9k_XxTlddgsUHBZw7Gy0dZNaCLTq43TzbylmOJOxGZC3YOZaol-7A4Sbqe_LnjNjJ-fJWiug7hcIPVxv1X/s1600/worst_slew_propagation.png) |
| **Figure 1: Figure showing worst slew propagation** |
One may feel
this as an over-pessimism inserted by timing analysis tool. Path based timing analysis will not have worst slew propagation phenomenon as it calculates output slew for each timing path rather than one slew per node.
Similarly, for
performing timing analysis for hold violations, the best of the slews at inputs
is propagated to the output as mentioned before also.

### 8. Depletion MOSFET and negative logic. Why it is not possible?

**Date:** 2014-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/08/why-depletion-mosfet-cannot-be-used-to.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/08/why-depletion-mosfet-cannot-be-used-to.html)

### Depletion MOSFET and negative logic. Why it is not possible?
As we know, depletion
MOSFET conducts current even with gate and source at same voltage level. To
cut-off the current in depletion MOSFET, a voltage has to be applied at gate so
as to exhaust the already existing carriers inside the channel. On the other
hand, enhancement type MOSFET is cut-off when gate and source are at same
voltage.
Taking the
example of NMOS, for a depletion MOS, with source and gate at same level, there
is still a channel available, hence, it conducts electric current. To bring it
to cut-off, a negative potential is needed to be applied at gate (considering
source at ‘X’ potential). Thus, with source at ‘X’ potential and gate at ‘X’
potential, drain attains the potential of source. Since, to cut-off the device,
gate has to be given a voltage less than ‘X’, so we can say “when Gate is 1 and
source is 1, then drain is 1”.  On the
other hand, when source is 1 and gate is 0, drain attains ‘high impedance’. The
reverse is true for PMOS.
Similarly, with
the same logic, for an enhancement NMOS, “When Gate is 1 and source is 0, drain
attains 0 potential”; similarly, “When Gate is 0 and source is 0, drain is 0”.
The reverse is true for PMOS.
|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Source voltage | Gate voltage | Drain voltage for enhancement NMOS | Drain voltage for enhancement PMOS | Drain voltage for depletion NMOS | Drain voltage for depletion PMOS |
| 0 | 0 | Z | Z | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | Z | 0 | Z |
| 1 | 0 | Z | 1 | Z | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | Z | Z | 1 | 1 |
Thus, we can say
that it is due to the inherent properties of NMOS and PMOS that that they
cannot be used to create negative level logic.

### 9. Enhancement and depletion MOSFETs

**Date:** 2014-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/08/enhancement-and-depletion-mode-mosfets.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/08/enhancement-and-depletion-mode-mosfets.html)

### Enhancement and depletion MOSFETs
A MOSFET (Metal
Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) is a 4-terminal device with
Source, Drain, Gate and Body as its terminals. It is used for amplification or
switching of electronic signals and is the most common transistor in both
digital and analog integrated circuits. The generic structure of a MOSFET is
shown in figure 1. The source and drain terminals are separated by a channel.
The conduction of the channel is determined by the carrier density in the
channel which is a function of voltage applied at the gate terminal. The body
terminal is normally connected to the source so as to allow only minimal
leakage current to flow.

| **Figure 1: A MOSFET** |
MOSFETs are categorized into two
categories based upon the nature of channel:
        1) **Enhancement**
**mode MOSFETs**: In an enhancement MOSFET, the channel is devoid of carriers. The
channel has to be created by creating a suitable voltage difference between
gate and source terminals. With gate and source at same potential, only minimal
current flows. However, when a positive potential difference is applied which
is greater than threshold voltage for the MOSFET, a channel is created. Thus,
the current will now flow between source and drain if there is a potential
difference between them. Figure 2 below shows how a channel is formed on applying a voltage between source and gate terminals.

| **Figure 2: Channel formation in Enhancement MOSFET** |
        2) **Depletion**
**mode MOSFETs**: In a depletion mode MOSFET, the channel is already present
with the help of ion-implantation.Even
with gate and source at same voltage, it will conduct current. The channel has
to be depleted by applying suitable potential.

What is the need for depletion and Enhancement both MOSFET to exist? Where do they use in real IC circuits? under what circumstance one is better than the other?

Hi
In today's technologies, you will find enhacement MOSFETS getting used predominantly. One of the main reasons I can understand is the inability to implement inverting logic using depletion MOSFET. Another reason is that you need to implant a very thin layer of charge using ion implantation for depletion MOSFETs. I guess there were not much efforts towards making this process economical.

### 10. False paths basics and examples

**Date:** 2014-07

### False paths basics and examples
False path is a very
common term used in STA. It refers to a timing path which is not required to be
optimized for timing as it will never be required to get captured in a limited time when excited in normal working situation of
the chip. In normal scenario, the signal launched from a flip-flop has to get
captured at another flip-flop in only one clock cycle. However, there are
certain scenarios where it does not matter at what time the signal originating
from the transmitting flop arrives at the receiving flop. The timing path
resulting in such scenarios is labeled as false path and is not optimized for
timing by the optimization tool.
> **Definition of false path**: A timing path, which can get captured even after a very large interval of time has passes, and still, can produce the required output is termed as a false path. A false path, thus, does not need to get timed and can be ignored while doing timing analysis.
**Common false path scenarios**:  Below, we list some of the examples , where false paths can be applied:
> **Synchronized**
> **signals**: Let us say we have a two flop synchronizer placed between a
> sending and receiving flop (The sending and receiving flops may be working on
> different clocks or same clock). In this scenario, it is not required to meet
> timing from launching flop to first stage of synchronizer. Figure 1 below shows
> a two-flop synchronizer. We can consider the signal coming to flop1 as false,
> since, even if the signal causes flop1 to be metastable, it will get resolved
> before next clock edge arrives with the success rate governed by MTBF of the
> synchronizer. This kind of false path is also known as **Clock domain crossing (CDC)**.
[![The paths to synchronizer are false as the metastability is accounter for](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLXk6BDnDC_CsH3e0G9p2NmAY7S3-fJvhx3kXYkP9kWgx5WX67Rxo4m0IHZdlsqpaaPY9gA-YiFsJz5qez1bW4C0bNuQ0KGyPcsPuGnD2e9wSh3GmMCIGX4i8AzZl5eWF-bSSJ_KGxfBmN/s1600/2-flop+synchronizer.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLXk6BDnDC_CsH3e0G9p2NmAY7S3-fJvhx3kXYkP9kWgx5WX67Rxo4m0IHZdlsqpaaPY9gA-YiFsJz5qez1bW4C0bNuQ0KGyPcsPuGnD2e9wSh3GmMCIGX4i8AzZl5eWF-bSSJ_KGxfBmN/s1600/2-flop+synchronizer.png)
**Figure 1: A two flop synchronizer**
However, this does not mean that wherever you see a chain of
two flops, there is a false path to first flop. The two flops may be for
pipelining the logic. So, once it is confirmed that there is a synchronizer,
you can specify the signal as false.
Similarly, for other types of synchronizers as well, you can
specify false paths.
**False**
**paths for static signals arising due to merging of modes**: Suppose you
have a structure as shown in figure 1 below. You have two modes, and the path
to multiplexer output is different depending upon the mode. However, in order
to cover timing for both the modes, you have to keep the “Mode select bit”
unconstrained. This result in paths being formed through multiplexer select
also. You can specify " **set false path**" through select of multiplexer as this will be
static in both the modes, if there are no special timing requirements related to mode transition on this
signal. Specifically speaking, for the scenario shown in figure 1,
**Mode 1** : set\_case\_analysis 0 MUX/SEL
**Mode 2** : set\_case\_analysis 1 MUX/SEL
**Mode with Mode1 and Mode2 merged together** : set\_false\_path -through MUX/SEL
[![Select signal selects between two paths for different modes](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgI-qGDnR99BmKaCsmLivsihtNLiqcMTutkHXtxWKWtmkLTVpNCdnCFKUnTUsPbXDSIzqC0RJJ07NLHCsjP89dqfJ5SK22SG_VPhhatnPgEaIfZKeSKZMnJVL48WtMD3Hx5Wp8YI7tfl5m-/s1600/false+paths+mode+merging.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgI-qGDnR99BmKaCsmLivsihtNLiqcMTutkHXtxWKWtmkLTVpNCdnCFKUnTUsPbXDSIzqC0RJJ07NLHCsjP89dqfJ5SK22SG_VPhhatnPgEaIfZKeSKZMnJVL48WtMD3Hx5Wp8YI7tfl5m-/s1600/false+paths+mode+merging.png)
**Figure 2: Mode selection signal**
**selecting between mode1 and mode2 paths**
**Architectural**
**false paths**: There are some timing paths that are never possible to
occur. Let us illustrate with the help of a hypothetical, but very simplistic
example that will help understand the scenario. Suppose we have a scenario in
which the select signals of two 2:1 multiplexers are tied to same signal. Thus,
there cannot be a scenario where data through in0 pin of MUX0 can traverse
through in1 pin of MUX1. Hence, it is a false path by design architecture.
Figure 3 below depicts the scenario.
[![Figure shows an example of a path that is false by architecture.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4zuWVeZEG9S2sPlTK7PMMhgk5j5rRQVGXaMktEdXMTWA4oiuf040WNx8RCIyW225_f0IwOjy4rerszwFrrEShOIRfk0GNegkioBZ4-vggVPQiPwZgWCc7aE_Mj-xklbkH87tium4nUOHW/s1600/false+path+architectural.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4zuWVeZEG9S2sPlTK7PMMhgk5j5rRQVGXaMktEdXMTWA4oiuf040WNx8RCIyW225_f0IwOjy4rerszwFrrEShOIRfk0GNegkioBZ4-vggVPQiPwZgWCc7aE_Mj-xklbkH87tium4nUOHW/s1600/false+path+architectural.png)
**Figure 3: A hypothetical example**
**showing architectural false path**
**Specifying false path**: The SDC command to specify a timing path as false path is " **set\_false\_path**". We can apply false path in following cases:
-      From register to register paths
  - **set\_false\_path -from regA -to regB**
-      Paths being launched from one clock and being captured at another
  - **set\_false\_path -from \[get\_clocks clk1\] -to \[get\_clocks clk2\]**
-      Through a signal
  - **set\_false\_path -through \[get\_pins AND1/B\]**

### 11. Negative gate delay - is it possible

**Date:** 2014-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/07/is-it-possible-for-logic-gate-to-have.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/07/is-it-possible-for-logic-gate-to-have.html)

### Negative gate delay - is it possible
As discussed in
our post ‘ [propagation\\
delay](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2014/07/propagation-delay.html)’, the difference in time from the input reaching 50% of the final
value of the transition to that of the output is termed as propagation delay.
It seems a bit absurd to have negative value of propagation delay as it
provides a misinterpretation of the effect happening before the cause. Common
sense says that the output should only change after input. However, under
certain special cases, it is possible to have negative delay. In most of such cases, we have one or
more of the following conditions:
i)A high drive strength transistor
ii)Slow transition at the input
iii)Small load at the output
Under all of the above mentioned conditions, the output is expected to transition faster than the input signal,
and can result in negative propagation delay. An example negative delay scenario is shown in the
figure below. The output signal starts to change only after the input signal;
however, the faster transition of the output signal causes it to attain 50%
level before input signal, thus, resulting in negative propagation delay. In other words, negative delay is a relative concept.

### 12. Propagation Delay

**Date:** 2014-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/07/propagation-delay.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/07/propagation-delay.html)

### Propagation Delay
**What is propagation delay**: Propagation delay of a logic gate is defined as the time it takes for the effect of change in input to be visible at the output. In other words, propagation delay is the time required for the input to be propagated to the output. Normally, it is defined as the difference
between the times when the transitioning input reaches 50% of its final value
to the time when the output reaches 50% of the final value showing the effect
of input change. Here, 50% is the defined as the logic threshold where output (or, in particular, any signal) is assumed to switch its states.

| **Figure 1: 2-input AND gate** |
**Propagation delay example**: Let us consider a 2-input AND gate as shown in figure 1, with input ‘I2’ making transition from logic ‘0’ to logic ‘1’ and 'I1' being stable at logic value '1'. In effect, it will cause the output ‘O’ also to make a transition. The output will not show the effect immediately, but after certain time interval. The timing diagram for the transitions are also shown. The propagation delay, in this case, will be the time interval between I2 reaching 50% while rising to 'O' reaching 50% mark while rising as a result of 'I2' making a transition. The propagation delay is labeled as “TP” in figure 2.

| [![The propagation delay is the time from 50 percent of transitioning input to 50% of transitioning output](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtgTV9pDeU0lZwbHe-quBdhaX0BVyLdqQ8vEBhE7VZ85CVEGUdUJPdWqeXz2EnhWvoLTBw2FrWm_cIjg2QpMovPN-VRrsvYSfP0JPmFkJiVjZqfxc_GpIHjqMcSKLc3Js9IIE4_Jw6Po3Z/s1600/propagation+delay.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtgTV9pDeU0lZwbHe-quBdhaX0BVyLdqQ8vEBhE7VZ85CVEGUdUJPdWqeXz2EnhWvoLTBw2FrWm_cIjg2QpMovPN-VRrsvYSfP0JPmFkJiVjZqfxc_GpIHjqMcSKLc3Js9IIE4_Jw6Po3Z/s1600/propagation+delay.png) |
| **Figure 2: Propagation delay** |
**On what factors propagation delay**
**depends**: The propagation delay of a logic gate is not a constant value,
but is dependent upon two factors:
1. **Transition time of the input causing transition**
**at the output**: More the transition time at the input, more will be the propagation delay of the cell. For less propagation delays, the signals should switch faster.
2. **The output load being felt by the logic gate**:Greater is the capacitive load sitting at the output of the cell, more will be the effort put (time taken) to charge it. Hence, greater is the propagation delay.
How Propagation delay of logic gates is calculated: In physical design tools, there can be following sources of calculation of propagation delay:
- **Liberty file**: Liberty file contains a lookup table for the each input-to-output path (also called as cell arc) for logic gates as .lib models. The table contains values for different input transition times and output loads corresponding to cell delay. Depending upon the input transition and output load that is present in the design for the logic gate under consideration, physical design tools interpolate between these values and calculate the cell delay.
- **SDF file**: SDF (Standard Delay Format) is the extracted delay information of a design. The current delay information, as calculated, can be dumped into SDF file. It can, then, be read back. In case SDF is read, delays are not calculated and SDF delays are given precedence.
Output transition time: The output transition time is also governed by the same two factors as propagation delay. In other words, larger transition time and load increase the transition time of the signal at the output of the logic gate. So, for better transition times, both of these should be less.

You can say that Td = f(input\_transition,output\_load).
Even if there is an exact formula, that is too complex that even timing libraries prefer LUT (look up table) in place of formulas to derive propagation delay.

Higher input transition causes higher cell delay & higher output load causes higher cell delay as well.

### 13. Multicycle paths : The architectural perspective

**Date:** 2014-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/07/multicycle-paths-sta.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/07/multicycle-paths-sta.html)

### Multicycle paths : The architectural perspective
**Definition of multicycle paths**: By definition, a
multi-cycle path is one in which data launched from one flop is allowed (through architecture definition) to take more than
one clock cycle to reach to the destination flop. And it is architecturally
ensured either by gating the data or clock from reaching the destination flops.
There can be many such scenarios inside a System on Chip where we can apply multi-cycle paths as discussed later. In this post, we discuss architectural aspects of multicycle paths. For timing aspects like application, analysis etc, please refer [Multicycle paths handling in STA](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/07/multicycle-path-sta.html).
**Why multi-cycle paths are introduced in**
**designs**: A typical System on Chip consists of many components working
in tandem. Each of these works on different frequencies depending upon
performance and other requirements. Ideally, the designer would want the
maximum throughput possible from each component in design with paying proper
respect to power, timing and area constraints. The designer may think to
introduce multi-cycle paths in the design in one of the following scenarios:
       1) **Very**
**large data-path limiting the frequency of entire component**: Let us take a
hypothetical case in which one of the components is to be designed to work at
500 MHz; however, one of the data-paths is too large to work at this frequency.
Let us say, minimum the data-path under consideration can take is 3 ns. Thus, if
we assume all the paths as single cycle, the component cannot work at more than
333 MHz; however, if we ignore this path, the rest of the design can attain 500
MHz without much difficulty. Thus, we can sacrifice this path only so that the
rest of the component will work at 500 MHz. In that case, we can make that
particular path as a multi-cycle path so that it will work at 250 MHz
sacrificing the performance for that one path only.
     2) **Paths**
**starting from slow clock and ending at fast clock**: For simplicity, let us suppose there is
a data-path involving one start-point and one end point with the start-point
receiving clock that is half in frequency to that of the end point. Now, the
start-point can only send the data at half the rate than the end point can
receive. Therefore, there is no gain in running the end-point at double the
clock frequency. Also, since, the data is launched once only two cycles, we can
modify the architecture such that the data is received after a gap of one
cycle. In other words, instead of single cycle data-path, we can afford a two
cycle data-path in such a case. This will actually save power as the data-path
now has two cycles to traverse to the endpoint. So, less drive strength cells
with less area and power can be used. Also, if the multi-cycle has been
implemented through clock enable (discussed later), clock power will also be saved.
**Implementation of multi-cycle paths in**
**architecture**: Let us discuss some of the ways of introducing
multi-cycle paths in the design:
      1) **Through**
**gating in data-path**: Refer to figure 1 below, wherein ‘Enable’ signal gates
the data-path towards the capturing flip-flop. Now, by controlling the waveform
at enable signal, we can make the signal multi-cycle. As is shown in the
waveform, if the enable signal toggles once every three cycles, the data at the
end-point toggles after three cycles. Hence, the data launched at edge ‘1’ can
arrive at capturing flop only at edge ‘4’. Thus, we can have a multi-cycle of 3
in this case getting a total of 3 cycles for data to traverse to capture flop.
Thus, in this case, the setup check is of 3 cycles and hold check is 0 cycle.

| **Figure 1: Introducing multicycle paths in design by gating data path** |
Now let us
extend this discussion to the case wherein the launch clock is half in
frequency to the capture clock. Let us say, Enable changes once every two
cycles. Here, the intention is to make the data-path a multi-cycle of 2
relative to faster clock (capture clock here). As is evident from the figure
below, it is important to have Enable signal take proper waveform as on the
waveform on right hand side of figure 2. In this case, the setup check will be
two cycles of capture clock and hold check will be 0 cycle.
|     |
| [![When the launch clock is half in frequency, it is better to make the path a multicycle of 2 because data will anyways be launched once every few cycles.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkHJi6hiKH6KnEeYbfjywJXd56oU7StOEjfhMHovfFPxrsfve9uw-AdHeDyyZw3XFM25oTGyHEvvg9BekrR04bzruLcG09D7IfJBRsCW1bpqqHQ3KhFxENKrl0r-tLO-PFn1oQcpTRwWzC/s1600/multicycle-path-when-capture-clock-is-double-in-frequency-than-launch-clock.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkHJi6hiKH6KnEeYbfjywJXd56oU7StOEjfhMHovfFPxrsfve9uw-AdHeDyyZw3XFM25oTGyHEvvg9BekrR04bzruLcG09D7IfJBRsCW1bpqqHQ3KhFxENKrl0r-tLO-PFn1oQcpTRwWzC/s1600/multicycle-path-when-capture-clock-is-double-in-frequency-than-launch-clock.png) |
| **Figure 2: Introducing multi-cycle path where**<br>**launch clock is half in  frequency to**<br>**capture clock** |
**2) Through gating in clock path:** Similarly, we can make the capturing flop capture
data once every few cycles by clipping the clock. In other words, send only
those pulses of clock to the capturing flip-flop at which you want the data to
be captured. This can be done similar to data-path masking as discussed in
point 1 with the only difference being that the enable will be masking the
clock signal going to the capturing flop. This kind of gating is more
advantageous in terms of power saving. Since, the capturing flip-flop does not
get clock signal, so we save some power too.

| **Figure 3: Introducing multi cycle paths through gating the clock path** |
      Figure 3 above shows how multicycle paths can be achieved with the help of clock gating. The enable signal, in this case, launches from negative edge-triggered register due to architectural reasons ( [read here](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2014/05/clock-switching-and-clock-gating-checks.html)). With the enable waveform as shown in figure 3, flop will get clock pulse once in every four cycles. Thus, we can have a multicycle path of 4 cycles from launch to capture. The setup check and hold check, in this case, is also shown in figure 3. The setup check will be a 4 cycle check, whereas hold check will be a zero cycle check.
**Pipelining v/s introducing multi-cycle**
**paths**: Making a long data-path to get to destination in two cycles can
alternatively be implemented through pipelining the logic. This is much simpler
approach in most of the cases than making the path multi-cycle. Pipelining
means splitting the data-path into two halves and putting a flop between them,
essentially making the data-path two cycles. This approach also eases the
timing at the cost of performance of the data-path. However, looking at the
whole component level, we can afford to run the whole component at higher
frequency. But in some situations, it is not economical to insert pipelined
flops as there may not be suitable points available. In such a scenario, we
have to go with the approach of making the path multi-cycle.

Hi,
I have doubt in diagram 3. which flipflop is used while generating enable signal. Is it D or T? if it is D with always high input how enable signal goes down in once it gets set on negedge. If it is T flipflop why it didnt toggle in between two pulses of present enable signal when negedge of capture flop arrives.
If it is D with

Hi Nikhil
The enable generation logic does not need to be so simple. It may be state machine working on positive edge and then a negative edge-triggered D flip-flop acting as a pipeline as well. :-)
And you are right, the waveforms should reflect the design. I haven't shown the complete design as the intent was to show how a multicycle path is formed.

This is because the timing path between launch and capture flops is enabled every third cycle. So, if setup check is 3 cycles, hold check is 0 cycle. In other words, it is governed by how you write the RTL code; i.e. it is governed by architecture.

In your last paragraph you mention that pipelining "eases the timing at the cost of performance of the data-path". How is performance negatively impacted when that path was going to take two cycles anyway. You shouldn't be negatively impacting the performance.
One reason that I think you should have highlighted is why exactly some paths cannot be pipelined and are forced to be multicycled instead. Pipelining adds the setup and clk-to-q delays of the newly added pipeline flop to your existing path. So if the combo logic needed for that path cannot handle the added setup and clk-to-q delays of pipeline flop then you have to multicycle.

Hi
With multicycling, you have to reduce the toggling of the data. This is not the case with pipelining. The path will take 2 cycles, but still it can toggle at same rate.

### 14. Clock gating checks

**Date:** 2014-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/05/clock-switching-and-clock-gating-checks.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/05/clock-switching-and-clock-gating-checks.html)

### Clock gating checks
Today’s designs
have many functional as well as test modes. A number of clocks propagate to
different parts of design in different modes. And a number of control signals
are there which control these clocks. These signals are behind switching on and off the
design. Let us say, we have a simple design as shown in the figure below. Pin
‘SEL’ selects between two clocks. Also, ‘EN’ selects if clock will be
propagating to the sub-design or not. Similarly, there are signals that decide
what, when, where and how for propagation of clocks. Some of these controlling
signals may be static while some of these might be dynamic. Even with all this,
these signals should not play with waveform of the clock; i.e. these should not
cause any glitch in clock path. There are both architectural as well as timing
care-abouts that are to be taken care of while designing for signals toggling in
clock paths. This scenario is widely known as ‘clock gating’. The timing checks
that need to be modeled in timing constraints are known as ‘clock gating
checks’.

Further, there is a signal EN which decides if selected clock will propagate or not](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzdf2_ctQpxfRXL8HcEQdqp1TS4DGC8sSSSqKc18W4hlHAYwy9sycRKBYgYq1hac89VupoRQ33OrFAgGjaFhxtUuhcK9D2_EpsH-9N1iMVBVR1BTZ1Bl7-7MOPzT0mJM1fWQrgFM9Wce8X/s1600/typical_clocking_scheme.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzdf2_ctQpxfRXL8HcEQdqp1TS4DGC8sSSSqKc18W4hlHAYwy9sycRKBYgYq1hac89VupoRQ33OrFAgGjaFhxtUuhcK9D2_EpsH-9N1iMVBVR1BTZ1Bl7-7MOPzT0mJM1fWQrgFM9Wce8X/s1600/typical_clocking_scheme.png) |
| **Figure**<br>**1: A simplest clocking**<br>**structure** |
**Definition of clock gating check**: A clock gating check is a constraint, either applied or inferred automatically by tool, that ensures that the clock will propagate without any glitch through the gate.
**Types of clock gating checks**: Fundamentally,
all clock gating checks can be categorized into two types:
**AND type clock gating check**:
Let us say we have a 2-input AND gate in which one of the inputs has a clock
and the other input has a data which will toggle while the clock is still on.

| **Figure 2: AND type clock gating check; EN signal**<br>**controlling CLK\_IN through AND gate** |
Since, the clock
is free-running, we have to ensure that the change of state of enable signal
does not cause the output of the AND gate
to toggle. This is only possible if the enable input toggles when clock is at
‘0’ state. As is shown in figure 3 below, if ‘EN’ toggles when ‘CLK\_IN’ is
high, the clock pulse gets clipped. In other words, we do not get full duty
cycle of the clock. Thus, this is a functional architectural miss causing
glitch in clock path. As is evident in figure 4, if ‘EN’ changes during
‘CLK\_IN’ are low, there is no change in clock duty cycle. Hence, this is the
right way to gate a clock signal with an enable signal; i.e. make the enable
toggle only when clock is low.

| **Figure**<br>**4: Clock waveform not being**<br>**altered when ‘EN’ changes when ‘CLK\_IN’ is low** |
Theoretically,
‘EN’ can launch from either positive edge-triggered or negative edge-triggered
flops. In case ‘EN’ is launched by a positive edge-triggered flop, the setup
and hold checks will be as shown in figure 5. As shown, setup check in this
case is on the next positive edge and hold check is on next negative edge.
However, the ratio of maximum and minimum delays of cells in extreme operating
conditions may be as high as 3. So, architecturally, this situation is not
possible to guarantee the clock to pass under all conditions.

| **Figure**<br>**5: Clock gating setup and hold**<br>**checks on AND gate when 'EN' launches from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop** |
On the contrary,
if ‘EN’ launches from a negative edge-triggered flip-flop, setup check are
formed with respect to the next rising edge and hold check is on the same
falling edge (zero-cycle) as that of the launch edge. The same is shown in figure 6. Since,
in this case, hold check is 0 cycle, both the checks are possible to be met for
all operating conditions; hence, this solution will guarantee the clock to pass
under all operating condition provided the setup check is met for worst case
condition. The inactive clock state, as evident, in this case, is '0'.

| **Figure 7: An OR gate controlling a**<br>**clock signal 'CLK\_IN'** |
**OR type clock gating check**:
Similarly, since the off-state of OR gate is 1, the enable for an OR type clock
gating check can change only when the clock is at ‘1’ state. That is, we have
to ensure that the change of state of enable signal does not cause the output
of the OR gate to toggle. Figure 9 below shows if ‘EN’ toggles when ‘CLK\_IN’
is high, there is no change in duty cycle. However, if ‘EN’ toggles when
‘CLK\_IN’ is low (figure 8), the clock pulse gets clipped. Thus, ‘EN’ must be
allowed to toggle only when ‘CLK\_IN’ is high.

As in case of
AND gate, here also, ‘EN’ can launch from either positive or negative edge
flops. In case ‘EN’ launches from negative edge-triggered flop, the setup and
hold checks will be as shown in the figure 10. The setup check is on the next
negative edge and hold check is on the next positive edge. As discussed earlier, it cannot guarantee
the glitch less propagation of clock.

| **Figure**<br>**10: Clock gating setup and hold**<br>**checks on OR gate when ‘EN’ launches from negative edge-triggered flip-flop** |
If ‘EN’ launches
from a positive edge-triggered flip-flop, setup check is with respect to next
falling edge and hold check is on the same rising edge as that of the launch
edge. The same is shown in figure 11. Since, the hold check is 0 cycle, both
setup and hold checks are guaranteed to be met under all operating conditions
provided the path has been optimized to meet setup check for worst case condition. The inactive clock state, evidently, in this case, is '1'.

We have, thus
far, discussed two fundamental types of clock gating checks. There may be
complex combinational cells other than 2-input AND or OR gates. However, for
these cells, too, the checks we have to meet between the clock and enable pins
will be of the above two types only. If the enable can change during low phase
of the clock only, it is said to be AND type clock gating check and vice-versa.
**SDC command for application of clock gating checks**: In STA, clock gating checks can be applied with the help of SDC command _set\_clock\_gating\_check_.

Hi .. The sequential element in Fig 5 and Fig 6 must be positive latch and negative latch instead of FF's right?

Hi.. I can sense where the query is coming from. Basically, a negative FF is a positive latch followed by a negative latch. So, the basic structure remains same with positive latch in negative FF becoming redundant in this case, if the signal do negative FF is coming from a positive FF. Also here we are just talking about discrete AND/OR as clock gating elements, and not ICGs. But in this discussion also, we can replace FFs with corresponding latch. I hope I was able to answer your query.

Hi
All the basic setup fixing techniques will help here, which are listed here:
https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2017/10/improving-duty-cycle-of-clock.html
Other than these, since, the setup check here is half cycle check, you can try to make negative pulse wider too. :-)

Why are these waveforms different from the ones here: https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/08/setup-and-hold-checks-part-ii-static.html? Shouldn't the posedge flop to AND gate path waveform be same as pos edge flop to pos edge latch? Also, how is a clocked AND gate different from the pos edge latch?

Hi
Very good question. And I must say you completely understand the concepts. I wrote this post when my understanding was limited, and I owe to update this post now with relevant information. Now, coming to your question, you are very right in saying so, but there is a slight twist that our state machines must be consistent with the setup/hold checks that we are following.
In case of a pos-flop -> AND gate, the setup/hold checks of a latch will work perfectly as far as timing is concerned, but you need to make an FSM that confirms to same. The default behavior of AND clock gating from pos flop is the one shown in this post.
This is due to the default behavior and widely accepted understanding of setup/hold checks.
Let us try to understand default behavior of setup/hold checks. Let us say, data is launched at time T. Now, the next instant data can be captured in a positive latch is T+, whereas in an AND gate (assuming perfect transitions), it is T+full\_cycle. This is why, the default behavior is different for both.

Hi
Launch flip-flop does not have anything to do with it. In case of AND gate, you need enable to toggle during clock low, so negative edge forms hold check and positive edge forms setup check. Vice-versa in case of an OR Gate.

you wrote " Figure 9 below shows if ‘EN’ toggles when ‘CLK\_IN’ is high, there is no change in duty cycle." but there is change in the duty cycle!
the clk\_out duty cycle is not as clk duty cycle, can you explain it please?

Can you elaborate more on Fig.6? I still don't get why hold/setup check. Next stage FF is omitted right? Plus, specify two waveforms in Fig 6 please. Thanks in advance.

As now a days we are using ICG, do we still need to check setup and hold in the above mentioned way?

mostly not, but you never know what kind of design you find being implemented.

### 15. Quiz : Clock gating check at a complex gate

**Date:** 2014-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/05/complex-gate-clock-gating-check.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/05/complex-gate-clock-gating-check.html)

### Quiz : Clock gating check at a complex gate
Problem: Consider a complex gate with internal structure as shown in figure below. One of the inputs gets clock while all others get data signals. What all (and what type of) clock gating checks exist?
|     |
| [![Clock gating checks at a complex gate](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiemnHXGPUMKNt20zrpw9iSZhtccr87tHAGb6DTp_fXCx4ayahmwoeFelJS6Wu31yrCOWnmodMswqAqARXy6d27rNTWqyn964_u06dpjSJyuycpdr4odmX6a3sG_5e5-S4HPCf9T4RqOJ-m/s1600/Problem.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiemnHXGPUMKNt20zrpw9iSZhtccr87tHAGb6DTp_fXCx4ayahmwoeFelJS6Wu31yrCOWnmodMswqAqARXy6d27rNTWqyn964_u06dpjSJyuycpdr4odmX6a3sG_5e5-S4HPCf9T4RqOJ-m/s1600/Problem.png) |
| **Figure:Problem figure** |
**Solution:** As we know, clock gating
checks can be of AND type or OR type. We can find the type of clock gating
check formed between a data and a clock signal by considering all other signals
as constant. Since, all the 4 data signals control **Clk** in one or the other way, there are following clock gating
checks formed:
      i) **Clock**
**gating check between Data1 and Clk:** As is evident, invert of **Clk** and **Data1** meet at OR gate ‘6’. Hence, there is OR type check between **invert of Clk** and **Data1.** In other words, **Data1**
can change only when **invert of Clk** **is high** or **Clk is low**. Hence, there is **AND**
**type check formed at gate 6**.
      ii) **Clock**
**gating check between Data2 and Clk:** Same as in case 1.
      iii) **Clock**
**gating check between Data3 and Clk**: There is **AND type check between Data3 and Clk.**
     iv) **Clock**
**gating check between Data4 and CLK**: As in 1 and 2, there is **AND type check between Data4 and Clk**.

It is because it is ÖR type between CLK\_bar and Data4. Hence, AND type between CLK and Data4. I hope it explains. :-)

### 16. Clock gating checks at a multiplexer (MUX)

**Date:** 2014-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/05/clock-gating-checks-at-multiplexer-mux.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/05/clock-gating-checks-at-multiplexer-mux.html)

### Clock gating checks at a multiplexer (MUX)
In the post ' [clock switching and clock gating checks](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2014/05/clock-switching-and-clock-gating-checks.html)', we discussed why clock gating checks are needed. Also, we discussed the
two basic types of clock gating checks. Let us go one step further. The most
common types of combinational cells with dynamic clock switching encountered in today’s
designs are multiplexers. We will be discussing the clock gating checks at a multiplexer.
For simplicity, let us say, we have a 2-input multiplexer with 1 select pin. There
can be two cases:
**Case 1**: Data signal at the
select pin of MUX used to select between two clocks
|     |
| [![Mux with Data signal used to select clock to propagate to output](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ8-MGfa5f85RdKOLqdnnvbyk_cycobLLZN_l-yaufNwJ_3T7eEeApTPqCRzVVNX5Um_iR-LurlvNAPD001sco71pTu1HP5HE2v17mk5lRbBXeCmPidPW49Y_AaVnnfnjEocogFExVNu6s/s1600/Mux+with+data+as+select.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ8-MGfa5f85RdKOLqdnnvbyk_cycobLLZN_l-yaufNwJ_3T7eEeApTPqCRzVVNX5Um_iR-LurlvNAPD001sco71pTu1HP5HE2v17mk5lRbBXeCmPidPW49Y_AaVnnfnjEocogFExVNu6s/s1600/Mux+with+data+as+select.png) |
| **Figure 1: MUX with Data as select dynamically selecting the clock signal to propagate to output** |
This scenario is
shown in figure 1 above. This situation normally arises when ‘Data’ acts as
clock select and dynamically selects which of the two clocks will propagate to
the output. The function of the MUX is given as:
**CLK\_OUT = Data.CLK1 +**
**Data’.CLK2**
The internal
structure (in terms of basic gates) is as shown below in figure 2.
|     |
| [![CLK_OUT = Data.CLK1 + Data’.CLK2](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgFbDYd90hNMtLpV-WVlggewZq37rx5xCfjJP7-DgVdXfqXoOmTpJk0oyMz4kBMEY_h8e-QB0wD54gWU_3vtvt2OmG0edeYUTfV61FP0vz6e8Ip5o7LfzPorK3-DieIgUPgfPQnbpU0VTkA/s1600/Internal+structure+of+mux.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgFbDYd90hNMtLpV-WVlggewZq37rx5xCfjJP7-DgVdXfqXoOmTpJk0oyMz4kBMEY_h8e-QB0wD54gWU_3vtvt2OmG0edeYUTfV61FP0vz6e8Ip5o7LfzPorK3-DieIgUPgfPQnbpU0VTkA/s1600/Internal+structure+of+mux.png) |
| **Figure 2: Internal structure of mux in figure 1** |
There will be two
clock gating checks formed:
1. **Between**
**CLK1 and Data:** There are two cases to be considered for this scenario:
- **When CLK2 is at state '0'**: In this scenario, if the data toggles when CLK1 is '0', it will pass without any glitches. On the other hand, there will be a glitch if data toggles when CLK1 is '1'. Thus, the mux acts as AND gate and there will be AND-type clock gating check.
- **When CLK2 is '1'**: In this scenario, if data toggles when CLK1 is '1', it will pass without any glitches; and will produce a glitch if toggled when CLK1 is '0'. In other words, MUX acts as an OR gate; hence, OR-type clock gating check will be formed in this case.
1. **2\. Between**
**CLK2 and Data**: This scenario also follows scenario '1'. And the type of clock gating check formed will be determined by the state of inactive clock.
2. 2. Thus, the type of clock gating check to be applied, in this case, depends upon the inactive state of the other clock. If it is '0', AND-type check will be formed. On the other hand, if it is '1', OR-type check will be formed.
**Case 2**: Clock signal is at
select line. This situation is most common in case of Mux-based configurable clock
dividers wherein output clock waveform is a function of the two data values.

| **Figure 3: Combination of Data1 and Data2 determines if CLK or CLK' will propagate to the output** |
In this case
too, there will be two kinds of clock gating checks formed:
i) **Between**
**CLK and Data1**: Here, both CLK and Data1 are input to a 2-input AND gate,
hence, there will be **AND type check**
**between CLK and Data1**. The following SDC command will serve the purpose:
> **set\_clock\_gating\_check -high 0.1 \[get\_pins MUX/Data1\]**
The above command will constrain an AND-type clock gating check of 100 ps on Data1 pin.
ii) **Between**
**CLK and Data2**: As is evident from figure 3, there will be AND type check
between CLK’ and Data2. This means Data2 can change only when CLK’ is low. In
other words, Data2 can change only when CLK is high. This means there is **OR type check between CLK and Data2.** The following command will do the job:
> **set\_clock\_gating\_check -low 0.1 \[get\_pins MUX/Data2\]**
The above command will constrain an  OR-type clock gating check of 100 ps on Data2 pin.
Thus, we have discussed how there are clock gating checks formed between different signals of a MUX.

Hi
There are two different gates in path of clk1. For different values of clk2, the effect of one of the gates propagates.

In the case 1, where data is used to select the clocks CLK1,CLK2. Basically we encounter with four combinations of CLK1/2, for 00, no glitch propagation, for 01, OR clock gate check, 10 And clock gate Check. For case 11 since the Data is changing when clock is high so AND clock gating should be checked for this combination. Could you please comment on CLK1=CLK2=1 and if Data changes?

Hi Yathish
Iappreciate your thinking, but since both D0 & D1 are at value 1, the transition at output will be 1 -> 1, so there will not be any glitch under normal circumtances the same way as 00.
However, there is a special case which can cause glitch here, if the propagation delay from D0 to OUT & D1 to OUT is not equal.

### Need for clock gating checks - need for glitchless clock propagation
One of the most
important things in designs is to ensure glitch free propagation of clocks.
Even a single glitch in clock path can cause the chip to be metastable and even
fail. **A glitch is any unwanted clock**
**pulse that may cause the sequential cells to consider it as an actual clock**
**pulse**. Thus, a glitch can put your device in an unwanted state that is
functionally never possible. That is why; there should never be a glitch in
clock path. Every effort should be done by designers to minimize its
probability. The figure below shows a flip-flop receiving a data signal and a
clock signal; if there is some glitch (unwanted change of state) in clock, it
will take it as a real clock edge and latch the data to its output. However, if
the pulse is too small, the data may not propagate properly to output and the
flop may go metastable.

| **Figure showing functional glitch in clock path** |
There may be following kind of
cells present in clock path:
     1) **Buffers/inverters**: Since, there is only
one input for a buffer/inverter, the glitch may occur on the output of these
gates only through coupling with other signals in the vicinity. If we ensure
that the buffer/inverter has good drive strength and that the load and
transition at its output are under a certain limit, we can be certain that the
glitch will not occur.
      2)   **Combinational gates**: There can be
combinational gates other than buffers/inverters in clock path, say, a 2-input
AND gate having an enable signal that tells if the clock is to be propagated or
not. Each combinational gate might have one or more clocks and data/enable
pins. Let us say, we have a two input AND gate with one input as clock and the
other acting as an enable to the clock. We can have following cases possible:
**i)** **The**
**other input is static**: By static, we mean the other input will not change
on the fly. In other words, whenever the enable will change, the clock will be
off. So, enable will not cause the waveform at the output of the gate to
change. This case is similar to a buffer/inverter as the other input will not
cause the shape of the output pulse to change.
**ii)** **The**
**other input is toggling:** In this case, the enable might affect the waveform
at the output of the gate to change. To ensure that there is not glitch causes
by this, there are certain requirements related to skew between data and clock
to be met, which will be discussed later in the text. These requirements are
termed as clock gating checks.
3   3)   **Sequential gates**: There may also be
sequential gates in clock path, say, a flop, a latch or an integrated clock
gating cell with the clock at its clock input and the enable for the clock will
be coming at its data input. The output of these cells will be a clock pulse.
For these also, two cases are possible as in case 2. In other words, if the
enable changes when clock is off, the enable is said to be static. In that
case, the output either has clock or does not have clock. On the other hand, if
the input is toggling while clock is there at the input, we may get away by
meeting the setup and hold checks for the enable signal with respect to clock
input.
As discussed above, to ensure a
glitch free propagation of clock at the output of the combinational gates, we
have to ensure some timing requirements between the enable signal and clock.
These timing requirements ensure that there is no functionally unwanted pulse
in clock path. If we ensure these timing requirements are met, there will be no
functional glitch in clock path. However, glitches due to crosstalk between
signals can still occur. There are other techniques to prevent glitches due to
crosstalk. The functional glitches in clock path can be prevented by ensuring
the above discussed timing requirements. In STA, these requirements are
enforced on designs through timing checks known as **clock gating checks**. By ensuring these checks are applied and taken
care of properly, an STA engineer can sign-off for functional glitches. In
later posts, we will be dealing with these checks in more details.

### 18. Timing Corners – dimensions in timing signoff

**Date:** 2014-01
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/01/timing-corners-dimensions-in-timing.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2014/01/timing-corners-dimensions-in-timing.html)

### Timing Corners – dimensions in timing signoff
Integrated
circuits are designed to work for a range of temperatures and voltages, and not
just for a single temperature and voltage. These have to work under different
environmental conditions and different electrical setup and user environments.
For instance, the temperature in the internals of an automobile may reach as
high as 150 degrees while operating. Also, automobiles may have to work in
colder regions where temperatures may reach -40 degrees during winters. So, a
chip designed for automobiles has to be designed so as to be able to work in
temperatures ranging from -40 to 150 degree Celsius. On the other hand,
consumer electronics may have to work in the range of -20 to +40 degrees only. Thus,
depending upon the application, the chip has to be robust enough to handle varying surrounding temperatures. Not just surrounding temperatures, the
voltage supplied by the voltage source may vary. The battery may have an output
voltage range. Also, the voltage regulator sitting inside or outside the chip
may have some inaccuracy range defined. Let us say, a SoC has a nominal
operating voltage of 1.2V with 10% variation. Thus, it can operate at any
voltage from 1.08 V to 1.32V. The integrated circuits have to be tolerable
enough to handle these variations. Not just these variations, the process by
which the integrated circuits are manufactured has variations due to its micro
nature. For example, while performing etching, the depth of etching may vary
from wafer to wafer, and from die to die. Similarly, doping, width of wires drawn, distance between wires may vary for each wire from chip-to-chip. Depending upon these, the behavior
(delay, static and dynamic power consumption etc) of cells on chip vary. These
variations are together referred as PVT (Process Voltage Temperature)
variations. The behavior of the devices also varies according to the PVT
variations. The library (liberty) models of the cells are characterized for
cell delays, transitions, static and dynamic power corresponding to different
PVT combinations. Not just for cells, for nets too, these variations are
possible. The net parameters (resistance, capacitance and inductance) may also
vary. These parameters also account for cell delay. In addition, nets introduce
delay of their own too. Hence, one may get nets with high or less delay. So,
these variations also have to be taken into account for robust integrated
circuit manufacture. This variation in net characteristic can be modeled as
their RC variation as it accounts for changes in resistance and capacitance
(ignoring inductance) of net.

The figure shows a racing car.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggovLIN7JUvTwX1GJEvOHuiiXFmYr9O1GUHmCtmQ5-3tAmHexVrlZTZJcQkeq4d_t04kdzvBQfuuO4pI7nGfQ0XWX_jKru7UANvcmO9kHX1ISL6Yfqsjr-rfhtyaxihwVd2kdz0__0tO2k/s1600/car_race_operating_condition.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggovLIN7JUvTwX1GJEvOHuiiXFmYr9O1GUHmCtmQ5-3tAmHexVrlZTZJcQkeq4d_t04kdzvBQfuuO4pI7nGfQ0XWX_jKru7UANvcmO9kHX1ISL6Yfqsjr-rfhtyaxihwVd2kdz0__0tO2k/s1600/car_race_operating_condition.jpg)** |
| **Figure 1: A racing car. (Taken from**<br>**en.wikipedia.com)** |
With proper
techniques, the patterns of the variations for both the cell and net parameters
(delay, power, resistance and capacitance) are characterized and their minima
and maxima are recorded. Each minima and maxima can be termed as a corner. Let
us say, each minima/maxima in cell characteristics as ‘ **PVT corner**’ and net characteristics as ‘ **extraction corner**’. Each
combination of PVT extraction corners is referred to as a ‘timing corner’ as it
represents a point where timing will be extreme. There is an assumption that if
the setup and hold conditions are met for the design at these corners, these
will be met at intermediate points and it will be safe to run under all
conditions. This is true in most of the cases, not always. There is always a
trade-off between number of signed-off corners and the sign-off quality.
For bigger
technologies, say 250 nm, only two corners used to be sufficient, one that
showed maximum cell delay and the other that showed least cell delay. Net variations
could be ignored for such technologies. In all, there used to be 2 PVT and 1
extraction corner. As we go down
technology nodes, net variations start coming into picture. Also, cell
characteristics do not show a linear behavior. Therefore, there is increased
number of PVT as well as extraction corners for lower technology nodes. For 28
nm, say, there can be 8 PVT corners as well 8 extraction corners. The number of
corners differs from foundry to foundry. The chip has to be signed off in each and every
corner to ensure it works in every corner. However, we may choose to sign-off
in lesser corners with applying some extra uncertainty as margin in lieu of not
signing off at these timing corners. The timing analyst needs to decide what is
appropriate depending upon the resources and schedule.

Hi
Great explanation! I have a question regarding signoff corners.
Lets say the operating voltages are 0.5 ,0.7 , 0.9 , 1.2. extraction is done on typical. Could there be any corner case in setup or hold where 0.9 or 0.7 can become worst corner? (considering its a single volt design)

Hi
What I know is that different operating voltages come with different specifications for the design in most of the cases.
For instance, your design might be required to support 1 GHz at 1.2 V, 800 MHz at 0.9 V and so on. So, in this case, any of the operating voltages can become worst corner for setup.
Even if the design is required to work at same frequency at all these voltages, still any of these voltages can be worst for hold, but most of the times the highest voltage is the worst for hold in terms of overall number of critical paths.

### 1. Regions of operation of MOS transistors

**Date:** 2013-10
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/10/regions-of-operation-of-mos-transistors.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/10/regions-of-operation-of-mos-transistors.html)

### Regions of operation of MOS transistors
A
Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET, or simply, MOS) is
a four terminal device. Figure 1 below shows the general representation of an
N-MOS (for PMOS, simply replace N regions with P and vice-versa). MOS is a
Voltage-controlled current source as the current through MOS is a function of
relative voltage levels of its terminals. The relative voltages of gate, drain
and source terminals (assuming bulk or substrate to be at same voltage as
source) determine the magnitude of current flowing in MOS. In each of these
regions, we can represent the current as a function of gate-to-source voltage
(VGS) and drain-to-source voltage (VDS).
|     |
| [![A MOS transistor can be considered as a 4-terminal device consisting of source, gate, drain and bulk (substrate).](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsDeMIvLSBAepINTinzGdrIWlT-tpLkvaIp1nwRk3ZlBvPRjFgkxSBGeby5cGeZK2nYROTsa54lRBsHwZSnsMpplwR1JyBIlOU7X1UWbPkx4PCmqDWuU38oaXGBFttvoxvfJxq0LZs2B6F/s400/MOS+transistor.bmp)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsDeMIvLSBAepINTinzGdrIWlT-tpLkvaIp1nwRk3ZlBvPRjFgkxSBGeby5cGeZK2nYROTsa54lRBsHwZSnsMpplwR1JyBIlOU7X1UWbPkx4PCmqDWuU38oaXGBFttvoxvfJxq0LZs2B6F/s1600/MOS+transistor.bmp) |
| **MOS transistor - a 4-transistor device** |
In a MOS device, the
current flows on formation of channel of carriers between source and drain
terminals. For this, voltage at gate terminal needs to be such that it attracts
carriers of appropriate type towards itself. When sufficient carriers are
attracted towards gate, channel is said to be formed. A current, then, flows
between source and drain terminals depending upon the voltage levels of these
terminals. The voltage level of substrate also impacts the magnitude of current
as it also determines the level of carriers in the channel.
For an N-MOS device, the
channel is formed by electrons. So, to attract electrons, gate voltage must be
greater than source voltage. For the formation of channel, the
difference between VG and VS (VG – VS)
must be greater than Vth (threshold voltage of the MOS).
Threshold voltage is
defined as the minimum difference in gate-to-source voltage needed for the
formation of channel in a MOS device. For NMOS, Vth is positive as
for channel formation gate needs to be at higher voltage as explained above. Similarly,
for PMOS, Vth is negative as gate needs to be at lower voltage than
source for channel to be formed.
On increasing gate voltage
beyond threshold voltage, current through MOS increases with increasing gate
voltage. Also, if we increase drain voltage keeping gate voltage constant,
current increases till a particular drain voltage. After that, increasing drain
voltage does not affect the current. Depending upon the relative voltages of
its terminals, MOS is said to operate in either of the cut-off, linear or
saturation region.
- **Cut**
**off region** – A MOS device is said to be operating
when the gate-to-source voltage is less than Vth. Thus, for MOS to
be in cut-off region, the necessary condition is –
0 < VGS
< Vth-for NMOS
0 > VGS
\> Vth-for
PMOS (as threshold voltage of PMOS is negative)
Cut-off
region is also known as sub-threshold region. In this region, the dependence of
current on gate voltage is exponential. The magnitude of current flowing
through MOS in cut-off region is negligible as the channel is not present. The
conduction happening in this region is known as sub-threshold conduction.
- **Linear**
**or non saturation region** – For an NMOS, as
gate voltage increases beyond threshold voltage, channel is formed between
source and drain terminals. Now, if there is voltage difference between source
and drain, current will flow. The magnitude of current increases linearly with
increasing drain voltage till a particular drain voltage determined by the
following relations –
VGS ≥
Vth
VDS < VGS
– Vth
The
current is, then, represented as a linear function of gate-to-source and
drain-to-source voltages. That is why, MOS is said to be operating in linear
region. The linear region voltage-current relation is given as follows:
Id(Linear) = µ Cox W/L
(Vgs – Vth – Vds/2) Vds.
> Similarly, for P-MOS transistor,
> condition for P-MOS to be in linear region is represented as:
VGS < Vth
ORVSG \> \|Vth\|
AndVDS
\> VGS \+ Vth OR VSD < VSG \- \|Vth\|
- **Saturation**
**Region** – For an NMOS, at a particular gate
and source voltage, there is a particular level of voltage for drain, beyond
which, increasing drain voltage seems to have no effect on current. When a MOS
operates in this region, it is said to be in saturation. The condition is given
as:
VGS
≥ Vth
VDS
\> VGS – Vth
The current, now, is a function only
of gate and source voltages.
Id(saturation) = µ Cox
W/L (Vgs – Vth – Vds/2)2
Please note that this is just a primitive formula for Id in saturation region, and there are many advanced equations, modelings equations available for the MOSFETs of advanced nodes like 3 nm etc. And it is seen that the Id actually becomes linear with respect to Vgs. And also depends upon Vds as well.

### 2. Synchronizers

**Date:** 2013-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/09/synchronization-schemes.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/09/synchronization-schemes.html)

### Synchronizers
Modern VLSI
designs have very complex architectures and multiple clock sources. Multiple
clock domains interact within the chip. Also, there are interfaces that connect
the chip to the outside world. If these different clock domains are not
properly synchronized, metastability events are bound to happen and may result
in chip failure. Synchronizers come to rescue to avoid fatal effects of
metastability arising due to signals crossing clock domain boundaries and are
must where two clock domains interact. Understanding metasbility and correct
design of synchronizers to prevent metastability happen is an art. For systems
with only one clock domain, synchronizers are required only when reading an asynchronous
signal.
|     |
|  |
**Synchronizers, a key to tolerate**
**metastability:** As mentioned earlier, asynchronous signals cause
catastrophic metastability failures when introduced into a clock domain. So,
the first thing that arises in one’s mind is to find ways to avoid
metastability failures. But the fact is that metastability cannot be avoided.
We have to learn to tolerate metastability. This is where synchronizers come to
rescue. A synchronizer is a digital circuit that converts an asynchronous
signal/a signal from a different clock domain into the recipient clock domain
so that it can be captured without introducing any metastability failure.
However, the introduction of synchronizers does not totally guarantee
prevention of metastability. It only reduces the chances of metastability by a
huge factor. Thus, a good synchronizer must be reliable with high MTBF, should
have low latency from source to destination domain and should have low
area/power impact. When a signal is passed from one clock domain to another
clock domain, the circuit that receives the signal needs to synchronize it.
Whatever metastability effects are to be caused due to this, have to be
absorbed in synchronizer circuit only. Thus, the purpose of synchronizer is to
prevent the downstream logic from metastable state of first flip-flop in new
clock domain.
**Flip-flop based synchronizer (Two**
**flip-flop synchronizer):** This is the most simple and most common
synchronization scheme and consists of two or more flip-flops in chain working
on the destination clock domain. This approach allows for an entire clock
period for the first flop to resolve metastability. Let us consider the simplest
case of a flip-flop synchronizer with 2 flops as shown in figure. Here, Q2 goes high 1 or 2 cycles
later than the input.
|     |

Source domain signal is converted to destination domain signal with much less (almost nil) chances of the output going metastable.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuWgEDrzqgC36enLot6EcykooJb-nZysNLAHJSrWb4cpLRoHs9E_ifM8uNTPuwXhwu0jhUWkCIuUI4YWBRsKyvrx54HSsXbpPLPF2-TWm-rXuaMKU7XvVRVjQcrfyQV6XkLlAdWx6JvjIn/s640/two+flop+synchronizer.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuWgEDrzqgC36enLot6EcykooJb-nZysNLAHJSrWb4cpLRoHs9E_ifM8uNTPuwXhwu0jhUWkCIuUI4YWBRsKyvrx54HSsXbpPLPF2-TWm-rXuaMKU7XvVRVjQcrfyQV6XkLlAdWx6JvjIn/s1600/two+flop+synchronizer.png) |
| **A two flip-flop synchronizer** |
As said earlier,
the two flop synchronizer converts a signal from source clock domain to
destination clock domain. The input to the first stage is asynchronous to the
destination clock. So, the output of first stage (Q1) might go metastable from
time to time. However, as long as metastability is resolved before next clock
edge, the output of second stage (Q2) should have valid logic levels (as shown
in figure 3). Thus, the asynchronous signal is synchronized with a maximum
latency of 2 clock cycles.Theoretically, it is still possible for the output of
first stage to be unresolved before it is to be sampled by second stage. In
that case, output of second stage will also go metastable. If the probability
of this event is high, then you need to consider having a three stage
synchronizer.

| [![The output of the first stage goes metastable frequently, but there is a great chance of it being resolved before the next clock edge. This is how two-flop synchronizer works.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3_8XNAabsZtO9Of0M3IFv3MdNJ1Dl7zw_UZlQaYf4lb9Hu1nu4z1rHE470Hy4S6tob7qHJw5lfL8Nn94wtiRM45oOWML2UK-xZ88FLZ_-Lco_ow-VJw-5YCkjoMR1L6emmQZAp_teOu3n/s640/waveform+showing+how+two+flop+synchronizer+resolves+metastability.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3_8XNAabsZtO9Of0M3IFv3MdNJ1Dl7zw_UZlQaYf4lb9Hu1nu4z1rHE470Hy4S6tob7qHJw5lfL8Nn94wtiRM45oOWML2UK-xZ88FLZ_-Lco_ow-VJw-5YCkjoMR1L6emmQZAp_teOu3n/s1600/waveform+showing+how+two+flop+synchronizer+resolves+metastability.png) |
| **Waveforms in a two flop synchronizer** |
A good two flip-flop
synchronizer design should have following characteristics:
- The two flops
should be placed as close as possible to allow the metastability at first stage
output maximum time to get resolved. Therefore, some ASIC libraries have built
in synchronizer stages. These have better MTBF and have very large flops used,
hence, consume more power.
- Two flop
synchronizer is the most basic design all other synchronizers are based upon.
- Source domain
signal is expected to remain stable for minimum two destination clock cycles so
that first stage is guaranteed to sample it on second clock edge. In some
cases, it is not possible even to predict the destination domain frequency. In
such cases, handshaking mechanism may be used.
- The two flop
synchronizer must be used to synchronize a single bit data only. Using multiple
two flops synchronizers to synchronize multi-bit data may lead to catastrophic
results as some bits might pass through in first cycle; others in second cycle.
Thus, the destination domain FSM may go in some undesired state.
- Another practice
that is forbidden is to synchronize same bit by two different synchronizers.
This may lead to one of these becoming 0, other becoming 1 leading into
inconsistent state.
- The two stages
in flop synchronizers are not enough for very high speed clocks as MTBF becomes
significantly low (eg. In processors, where clocks run in excess of 1 GHz). In
such cases, adding one extra stage will help.
- MTBF decreases
almost linearly with the number of synchronizers in the system. Thus, if your
system uses 1000 synchronizers, each of these must be designed with atleast
1000 times more MTBF than the actual reliability target.
**Handshaking based synchronizers:** As
discussed earlier, two flop synchronizer works only when there is one bit of
data transfer between the two clock domains and the result of using multiple
two-flop synchronizers to synchronize multi-bit data is catastrophic. The
solution for this is to implement handshaking based synchronization where the
transfer of data is controlled by handshaking protocol wherein source domain
places data on the ‘REQ’ signal. When it goes high, receiver knows data is
stable on bus and it is safe to sample the data. After sampling, the receiver
asserts ‘ACK’ signal. This signal is synchronized to the source domain and
informs the sender that data has been sampled successfully and it may send a
new data. Handshaking based synchronizers offer a good reliable communication
but reduce data transmission bandwidth as it takes many cycles to exchange
handshaking signals. Handshaking allows digital circuits to effectively
communicate with each other when response time of one or both circuits is
unpredictable.

| **Sequence of events in a handshaking protocol based synchronizer** |
**Mux based synchronizers:** As
mentioned above, two flop synchronizers are hazardous if used to synchronize
data which is more than 1-bit in width. In such situations, we may use
mux-based synchronization scheme. In this, the source domain sends an enable
signal indicating that it the data has been changed. This enable is
synchronized to the destination domain using the two flop synchronizer. This
synchronized signal acts as an enable signal indicating that the data on data
bus from source is stable and destination domain may latch the data. As shown
in the figure, two flop synchronizer acts as a sub-unit of mux based synchronization
scheme.

| **A mux-based synchronization scheme** |
**Two clock FIFO synchronizer:** FIFO
synchronizers are the most common fast synchronizers used in the VLSI industry.
There is a ‘ **cyclic buffer**’ (dual
port RAM) that is written into by the data coming from the source domain and
read by the destination domain. There are two pointers maintained; one
corresponding to write, other pointing to read. These pointers are used by
these two domains to conclude whether the FIFO is empty or full. For doing
this, the two pointers (from different clock domains) must be compared. Thus,
write pointer has to be synchronized to receive clock and vice-versa. Thus, it
is not data, but pointers that are synchronized. FIFO based synchronization is
used when there is need for speed matching or data width matching. In case of
speed matching, the faster port of FIFO normally handles burst transfers while
slower part handles constant rate transfers. In FIFO based synchronization,
average rate into and out of the FIFO are same in spite of different access
speeds and types.

"The two flops should be placed as close as possible to allow the metastability at first stage output maximum time to get resolved."
Can somebody please explain this? If the Flops of synchronizer are closer, doesn't it mean that the metastable output of first Flop will likely be captured by the second Flop. Also the next CLK edge will arrive sooner at the second Flop. Don't we want maximum delay between the two Flops of Synchronizer to give metastable state maximum time to settle to a valid value?

The two flip-flops should be placed as close as possible with an additional condition that hold timing for flop1 -> flop2 paths must be met.
We want maximum time between the stability of data at flop2/d to the arrival of clock edge at flop2.

### 3. Transmission Gates

**Date:** 2013-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/09/transmission-gates.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/09/transmission-gates.html)

### Transmission Gates
Transmission gates represent another class of logic circuits, which use Transmission gates as
basic building block. A transmission gate consist of a PMOS and NMOS connected in
parallel. Gate voltage applied to these gates is complementary of
each other (C and Cbar shown in figure 1). Transmission gates act as bidirectional switch between two
nodes A and B controlled by signal C. Gate of NMOS is connected to C
and gate of PMOS is connected to Cbar(invert of C). When control
signal C is high i.e. VDD, both transistor are on and provides a
low resistance path between A and B. On the other hand, when C is
low, both transistors are turned off and provide high impedance path
between A and B.

A detailed analysis of working of transmission gates follows:
**When input node A is connected to**
**VDD and control logic C is also high, C = 1**: The output
node B may be connected to capacitor. Let us say, voltage at output
node is Vout.
> **For PMOS**, Source of is at higher
> voltage than drain.
> **For NMOS**, drain is at higher voltage
> than Source terminal.
Hence, node A will act as source terminal for
pMOS and as drain terminal for nMOS.
> Drain to Source and gate
> to source voltages for nMOS are as :
**_V_** **_DS,n= VDD_**
**_– Vout_**
**_V_** **_GS,n= VDD – Vout_**
For nMOS to be turned off,
**V** **GS,n < Vth,n**
**_VDD – Vout_**
**_< Vth,n_**
**_Vout > VDD_**
**_– V_****_th,n_**(Cut

For Vout < VDD – Vth,n
**_VDS,n_**
**_\> VGS,n – Vth,n_**
i.e. will operate in saturation mode
Similarly for pMOS,
**_VDS,p=  Vout - VDD_**
**_VGS,p= – VDD_**
For pMOS to be turned off VGS,p
\> vth,p  threshold voltage for pMOS
is –ve so pMOS will always be turned on.
For pMOS to operate in linear region,
VDS \> VGS
– v**th,p**
Vout – VDD > -VDD –
V**th,p**
Vout > - V**th,p**
Vout > \|V**th,p**\|
For Vout ≤ \|Vth,p\|, pMOS will be in
saturation mode.
Unlike nMOS, pMOS remain turned on
regardless of output voltage Vout

Thus PMOS will always be
turned on, and as we know that PMOS Passes a strong 1 so voltage
level high will be transmitted unattenuated.
Similarly,
**When voltage at**
**node A,Vin = 0 and C = VDD**, node A will
act as source terminal for nMOS and will act as drain for pMOS. nMOS
will always be turned on hence level 0 will also be transmitted
unattenuated.

**when voltage at node**
**A,Vin = VDD and C = 0** node A will act as

VGS,n

Hence nMOS will be turned off
VGS,p = VDD – VDD = 0 >
Vth,p (Cut off region)
Thus both transistor will
remain off. Path between A and B will be an open circuit.
**when voltage at node**
**A,Vin = 0 and C = 0 :** node A will act as
source terminal for nMOS and will act as drain for pMOS.
VGS,n

VGS,p
= VDD – Vout
VGS,pwill be some positive voltage and threshold voltage of pMOS
,Vth,p is negative.
VGS,p
\> Vth,p (Cut off region)
Hence both transistor will remain off
and high impedance path exists between A and B.

### 4. Metal ECO - the process

**Date:** 2013-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/09/how-metal-ecos-are-done.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/09/how-metal-ecos-are-done.html)

### Metal ECO - the process
A metal-only ECO is carried out by changing only metal
interconnects in the design. Metal-only ECOs are very common in today’s
semiconductor industry as they save complete silicon re-spin. Sometimes there
may be need to change the design for various reasons, and that too, a minor
change. These changes may be due to some bug in the design or due to customer
demand. A metal-only ECO enables the design to be re-fabricated only for a
few layers. It is very cost-effective as for complete silicon re-spin, there
may be a requirement of around 100 layer masks to be manufactured. Metal-only
ECOs enable the older masks to be used for most of the layers. Only the layers
with changes in them need to be manufactured again, which is usually 2 to 4 in
case of metal-only ECOs.
The steps to carry out metal-only
ECOs are explained below:
1.) A number of spare cells are sprinkled throughout
the design before being taped-out so as to facilitate metal layer ECOs later
on. The set of spare cells is chosen very carefully considering in mind the nature of design and the probability of metal ECO later on (it depends upon how mature the design building blocks are)
2.) First, the changes to be made are evaluated if
these can be carried out by changing only metal layers. For this purpose, spare
cells in the vicinity of the ECO location need to be observed. If there is
enough number of spare cells there, these can be used. On the other hand, if
there is not enough number of spare cells to represent the logic change, the
ECO cannot be carried out using only metal layers. It has to be, then, carried
out using all the layers as more cells will need to be added. It will, then,
result in re-spin of the design.
3.) If there is enough number of spare cells
available, the appropriate spare cells to represent the design change are
selected in the vicinity of the logic to be changed. Interconnects are, then, modified so as to represent the modified
circuit.
4.) The resulting layout is checked for timing and
DRC/LVS violations. If everything is fine, the design is sent to be fabricated.
There, masks for the modified layers are manufactured using the older masks for
layers not modified.
5.) If there is any violation related to timing or
DRC/LVS, steps 2, 3 and 4 are repeated until the design is clean with respect
to these.

### 5. Digital Counters

**Date:** 2013-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/09/digital-counters_5593.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/09/digital-counters_5593.html)

### Digital Counters
Digital
Counters, as the name suggests, are digital circuits used for counting
occurrence of any event. For any digital system like a computer, counters are most
useful and versatile subsystem. A flip-flop can be used as a counter to count two
states since Flip flop has two states either 0 or 1. Similarly, two flip-flops
can be connected together to count 4 states (00, 01, 10, 11). Thus, with n flip-flops, we can make a counter that can count maximum 2n stages .
Digital counters have following properties:
**1)** **Asynchronous or Synchronous** – Asynchronous counters are one in
which output of one flip-flop drives succeeding FF. Only first FF needs clock.
All other Flops will be driven by its preceding FF. While in synchronous
counters All FF are clocked by same external clock pulse.
**2)** **Maximum number of counts** – Also known as Modulus of counter.
Modulus of counter is equal to total number of distinct stages through which
counter progresses. For example:A 4
Flip flop counter is often referred to as mod-16 counter i.e it can count 16
stages.
**3)** **Up or down counter** – It dictates whether counter counts
in upward or downward direction. For exp . 0 ->1->2->3->4->5->6->7
is up counter. 7->6->5->4->3->2->1->0 is down counter. The
counter which can count in up or down direction depending upon some external
signal(e.g _._ if _up(some_
_external signal)_ is 1, count in upward direction else in downward) is
called up-down counter.
**4)** **Free running or self stopping**– if counter begins counting again
after reaching its maximum stage,counter is called free running and if it stops
after reaching maximum stage value it is called self stopping. Free running
counters are also known as blind running counters.

### 6. All about clock signals

**Date:** 2013-09
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/09/clock-signal-in-vlsi.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/09/clock-signal-in-vlsi.html)

### All about clock signals
Today’s designs are dominated by digital devices. These are
all synchronous state machines consisting of flip-flops. The transition from
one state to next is synchronous and is governed by a signal known as **clock**. That is why, we have aptly
termed clock as ‘ **the in-charge of**
**synchronous designs**’.
**Definition of clock signal**: We can define a clock signal as the one which synchronizes the state transitions by keeping all the registers/state elements in synchronization. In common terminology, a clock signal is a signal that is used to trigger sequential devices (flip-flops in general). By this, we mean that _‘ **on the active state/edge of clock, data at input of flip-flops propagates to the output’**_. This propagation is termed as state transition. As shown in figure 1, the ‘2-bit’ ring counter transitions from state ‘01’ to ‘10’ on active clock edge.
|     |
| [![An example of a two bit ring counter making transition from one state to another on rising (active) edge of the clock](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDsndENDfUWTjiqw6vNZ8FCKvXaTc6WYdtVxzbWjL1DqYFPGIoZdm9rkBK8MUVaqh0NDSt2K9uqAnvlJFL-gA0LWnvdi4PYnVtjxOhtndhxxAwJ5IrMQvYQtENpU-SmfNel8ji07Pdc4wl/s640/state+transition+example.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDsndENDfUWTjiqw6vNZ8FCKvXaTc6WYdtVxzbWjL1DqYFPGIoZdm9rkBK8MUVaqh0NDSt2K9uqAnvlJFL-gA0LWnvdi4PYnVtjxOhtndhxxAwJ5IrMQvYQtENpU-SmfNel8ji07Pdc4wl/s1600/state+transition+example.png) |
| **Figure**<br>**1: Figure showing state**<br>**transition on active edge of clock** |
Clock signals occupy a very important place throughout the
chip design stages. Since, the state transition happens on clock transition,
the entire simulations including verification, static timing analysis and gate
level simulations roam around these clock signals only. If Static timing
analysis can be considered as a body, then clock is its blood. Also, during
physical implementation of the design, special care has to be given to the
placement and routing of clock elements, otherwise the design is likely to
fail. Clock elements are responsible for almost half the dynamic power
consumption in the design. That is why; clock has to be given the prime
importance.
**Clock tree**:
A clock signal originates from a clock source. There may be designs with a
single clock source, while some designs have multiple clock sources. The clock
signal is distributed in the design in the form of a tree; leafs of the tree
being analogous to the sequential devices being triggered by the clock signal
and the root being analogous to the clock source. That is why; the distribution
of clock in the design is termed as **clock**
**tree.** Normally, (except for sometimes when intentional skew is introduced
to cater some timing critical paths),the
clock tree is designed in such a way that it is balanced. By balanced clock
tree, we mean that the clock signal reaches each and every element of the
design almost at the same time. **Clock**
**tree synthesis** (placing and routing clock tree elements) is an important
step in the implementation process. Special cells and routing techniques are
used to ensure a robust clock tree.
**Clock domains:** By
clock domain, we mean ‘the set of flops being driven by the clock signal’. For
instance, the flops driven by system clock constitute system domain. Similarly,
there may be other domains. There may be multiple clock domains in a design;
some of these may be interacting with each other. For interacting clock
domains, there must be some phase relationship between the clock signals
otherwise there is chance of failure due to metastability. If phase relationship is
not possible to achieve, there should be clock domain synchronizers to reduce
the probability of metastability failure.
**Specifying a signal**
**as clock:** In EDA tools, ‘ **_create\_clock_**’
command is used to specify a signal as a clock. We have to pass the period of
the clock, clock definition point, its reference clock (if it is a generated
clock as discussed below), duty cycle, waveform etc. as argument to the
command.
**Master and**
**generated clocks**: EDA tools have the concept of master and generated
clocks. A generated clock is the one that is derived from another clock, known
as its master clock. The generated clock may be of the same frequency or
different frequency than its master clock. In general, **a generated clock is defined so as to distinguish it from its master in**
**terms of frequency, phase or domain relationship**.
**Some terminology**
**related to clock**: There are different terms related to clock signals,
described below:
- **Leading**
**and trailing clock edge**: When clock signal transitions from ‘0’ to ‘1’,
the clock edge is termed as leading edge. Similarly, when clock signal
transitions from ‘1’ to ‘0’, the clock edge is termed as trailing edge.
|     |
| ![Leading and trailing edges of the clock signal](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtIKGF01IQOhKAIFVyyaiDc8Sf_la5dX665DZLHxHtDHbNE3AaXhF67ssvB7EDNo2iUVcEBbcbMGAI5dRMULKpBcaZGQbTcoF0j2s9vZUxf1trBr2MQsqvmPLOkVTQqyFoshJLhWUheYBE/s640/leading+and+trailing+edge+of+clock.png) |
|  |
- **Launch**
**and capture edge**: Launch edge is that edge of the clock at which data
is launched by a flop. Similarly, capture edge is that edge of the clock at
which data is capture by a flop.
- **Clock**
**skew**: Clock skew is defined as the difference in arrival times of clock
signals at different leaf pins. Considering a set of flops, skew is the difference
in the minimum and maximum arrival times of the clock signal. Global skew is
the clock skew for the whole design. On the contrary, considering only a
portion of the design, the skew is termed as local skew.

### 7. Setup check and hold check for flop-to-latch timing paths

**Date:** 2013-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/08/setup-and-hold-checks-part-ii-static.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/08/setup-and-hold-checks-part-ii-static.html)

### Setup check and hold check for flop-to-latch timing paths
In the post ( [Setup and hold – basics of timinganalysis](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2013/06/setup-and-hold-basics-of-timing-analysis.html)), we introduced setup and hold timing requirements and also discussed
why these requirements are needed to be applied. In this post, we will be
discussing how these checks are applied for different cases for paths starting
from flops and ending at latches and vice-versa.
Present day designs are focused mainly on the paths
between flip-flops as the elements dominating in them are flip-flops. But there
are also some level-sensitive elements involved in data transfer in current-day
designs. So, we need to have knowledge of setup and hold checks for
flop-to-latch and latch-to-flop paths too. In this post, we will be discussing the
former case. In totality, there can be total 4 cases involved in flop-to-latch
paths as discussed below:
**1)** **Paths launching from positive**
**edge-triggered flip-flop and being captured at positive level-sensitive latch**: Figure 1 shows a path being
launched from a positive edge-triggered flop and being captured on a positive
level-sensitive latch. In this case, setup check is on the same rising edge (without time borrow) and next falling edge (with time borrow) and
hold check on the previous falling edge with respect to the edge at which data is
launched by the launching flop.

Figure below shows the waveforms for setup and hold
checks in case of paths starting from a positive edge triggered flip-flop and
ending at a positive level sensitive latch. As can be figured out, setup and
hold check equations can be described as:
**Tck->q +**
**Tprop \+ Tsetup < Tskew \+ Tperiod/2(for setup**
**check)**
**Tck->q +**
**Tprop \> Thold \+ Tskew \- (Tperiod/2)(for hold check)**

**2)** **Paths launching from positive**
**edge-triggered flip-flop and being captured at negative level-sensitive latch**: Figure 3 shows a path starting
from positive edge-triggered flip-flop and being captured at a negative level
sensitive latch. In this case, setup check is on the next falling edge (without time borrow) and on next positive edge (with time borrow). Hold
check on the same edge with respect to the edge at which data is launched (zero cycle hold check).

    Hi,
    For the case of positive edge-triggered FF to positive level-sensitive latch, why does the setup check (without time borrow) happen on same edges of launch and capture clock. Isn't the intended logic that the data launched on active edge of launch clock be captured on the next active edge (low-to-high in this case) of capture clock? Or am I not understanding the functionality of the design correctly? Please advise.

    Hi
    In case of latch, there is an active level (not active edge). This, in case of a positive latch, ranges from positive edge to negative edge. So, data can be captured anywhere in between.

    Still should the capture not be in next active level instead of same active level?

    Yeah, I think its incorrect. you should check it in the next cycle for setup time. If you are checking in the same cycle then there should be no hold violations in case 2 and 4. Please edit the post or clarify it.

    Great post! Thank you for this detailed analysis. Can you comment on the pros/cons of using time borrowing? In my understanding, you show that time borrowing gets you an extra 0.5 cycle on the setup check which could make timing easier to meet. On the other hand, it looks like time borrowing would allow Latch/Q to potentially be glitchy since Latch/D is allowed to change while the latch is transparent. If it's direct FF -> Latch with no combo logic in between then this is probably ok because you will only have 1 transition at Latch/D per clock cycle. However, if there is combo logic in between, (i.e., FF -> Combo -> Latch), then you could have many transitions at Latch/D per clock cycle which means power consumption could be increased if Latch/Q is driving any downstream logic. What are your thoughts on that? And are there any other pros/cons that you see with using time borrowing for FF -> Latch capture?

    Hi
    True, but i dont it will be too much to bother about.
    Remember, a flop is 2 latches in series. So by using a latch, we are saving area and power equivalent to half a flop as well.
    And its only the output of latch that will toggles extra. If it had been a flop, all kogic upto flop input would have toggled as well for wach of the target cases.

    In case of +ve edge triggered ff to +ve latch why is the setup check performed in the same clock cycle, isn't it supposed to be verified in the next cycle , so the new equation is supposed to be:
    Tck->q + Tprop + Tsetup < Tskew + Tperiod/2 + T period (extra term)

    Setup check should be on the next available level/edge to capture the data. As you can see, the data gets launched on positive edge. And after that, there is a transparency on the capturing element for the entire half cycle. The data launched would be captured on this transparent period. Hence, setup check is like this. You can imagine the level of latch as extension of closing edge. Example, a positive latch being a negative edge-triggered flop, with its negative edge being a level. I hope this clarifies. :-)

    Hi, one of the definitions of hold check is that "it prevents the current data to NOT override the previous data at the capture flop". The previous data is captured at previous negative edge, hence, we must prevent the current data to NOT be captured on the previous falling edge. Thats why, this is the way it is. Please let me know if you need a simpler explanation. :-)

    Hello,
    Great post.
    I have a question for the case of posedge triggered flop driving a positive level latch.
    Can you please elaborate on how did you arrive at the hold equation for it?
    Thanks

    Hi, as shown in figure 2, the hold check is on the previous falling edge (thus bringing -ClockPeriod/2 into picture). The rest is a generic equation, involving data delay (Tck2Q + Tprop) & clock path delay (Tskew, which is difference of capture and launch clock latencies) along with hold time of the flip-flop. Please let me know if any further clarification needed.

### 8. Implement 3 and 4 variable function using 8:1 MUX

**Date:** 2013-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/08/implement-3-and-4-variable-function.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/08/implement-3-and-4-variable-function.html)

### Implement 3 and 4 variable function using 8:1 MUX
Three variable  function can be easily implemented using 8:1 multiplexer.
connect 3 input lines to select lines of mux and connect 8 inputs of mux
to logic 0 or 1 according to function output. For example, let us say Function is
**F(X,Y,Z) = Σ(0,1,3,6)**
then
X,Y,Z will be connected to select lines of Mux and I0 , I1, I3 and I6
will be connected to logic 1(VDD) and other will be connected to logic 0
[![The output will select an input based upon the values provided at S0, S1 and S2](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjTDj-ZQivaQaJFR7XYMQ8dGjruztqgzSdozB_Bg8eF6vXMxy4ZiYMUy_Ltw5u6_IDogBXmGlxZD18xQTgoTVra9dkiJpf-zOH5LaVM7bzHq79iQVRWUNLIj-69Wgdctvjw20Yjc34b3vpP/s320/Mux_8_to_1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjTDj-ZQivaQaJFR7XYMQ8dGjruztqgzSdozB_Bg8eF6vXMxy4ZiYMUy_Ltw5u6_IDogBXmGlxZD18xQTgoTVra9dkiJpf-zOH5LaVM7bzHq79iQVRWUNLIj-69Wgdctvjw20Yjc34b3vpP/s1600/Mux_8_to_1.png)
For
a 4 variable function, there are 16 possible combinations. To implement
4 variable function using 8:1 MUX, use 3 input as select lines of MUX
and remaining 4th input and function will determine ith input of mux .
Let us demonstrate it with an example :
**F(A,B,C,D) = Σ(1,5,7,9,10,11,12)**
|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** | **Decimal**<br>**Equivalent** | **F** |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 9 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 10 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 11 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 12 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 13 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 6 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 14 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 7 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 15 | 0 |
|     |
| [![The function represented using 8:1 mux](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiUy-m7lcMuo8s7cVL60unOAHVaDC3UgMtI2WuGvZyyVhZ1LMngVpr_ZUw9FD_kWMLtrVxXwEdxtyczr2CRjwxuth2zl8pZLrfrKgUzYs_9JJgB7wHXw2WO0w17BCIktvB5v6Dn78E8Qenf/s320/Var_4_8_1_Mux.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiUy-m7lcMuo8s7cVL60unOAHVaDC3UgMtI2WuGvZyyVhZ1LMngVpr_ZUw9FD_kWMLtrVxXwEdxtyczr2CRjwxuth2zl8pZLrfrKgUzYs_9JJgB7wHXw2WO0w17BCIktvB5v6Dn78E8Qenf/s1600/Var_4_8_1_Mux.png) |
| **The 4 variable function represented using 8:1 mux** |
**ABar = ~A (inverted A)**
As shown in figure, B,C,D are used as select lines and A will be used input  of Mux. from Truth table, if B,C,D  are 0 then output F is 0 irrespective of status of A so I0 = 0. For I5(BCD = 101) output depend upon A.
**for A = 0,  F  = 1**
**for A = 1,  F =  0**
**Hence F = ~A (for BCD = 101)**
**I4, (B = 1, C = 0, D = 0),  F = A**
**I1, (B = 0, C =  0,D  = 1), F = 1 (irrespective of status of A)**
similarly All other inputs can be inferred in the same way.  Thus we can conclude that to implement n variable function, we need **2^(n-1) to 1 MUX** and an **inverter**. n-1 input lines shall be used as select lines and rest one will be used for input of MUX.

### 9. Race condition in digital circuits

**Date:** 2013-08
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/08/race-condition.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/08/race-condition.html)

### Race condition in digital circuits
In general, race condition refers
to a situation in which the result depends upon the sequence in which events
happen. In particular, a race condition occurs when a system/device is designed
assuming a particular sequence of events without taking steps to ensure it. In
logic gates, it happens when the inputs arrive at the gate in a sequence not
assumed while deriving the function. This results, sometimes, in the anomalous
behavior of the logic gate because of the unexpected dependence on the sequence
of arrival of inputs. Since, the function of the logic gate is calculated
assuming static inputs; the order of arrival may have impact on the output. We
can consider race condition as a situation in which two or more signals are
racing to have their effect on the output. This is how; race condition derives
its name.
For a very simple example,
consider the following logic function-
**Z = A . A’**
|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| [![AND gate having race condition](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh01eHUmtoIRe3Aa22r3JZWSU85qLe7WW8YimwiX0Si_wSnjmlOHKxs7obsrhnivlfdyGa9TnNegNNBzxcE15jiTmqZEV4VXG1m2f00kzV73Di8_pAoHXVftOyDUJQEJucCKYgS7xGPD8yJ/s640/AND+gate+race+condition.bmp)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh01eHUmtoIRe3Aa22r3JZWSU85qLe7WW8YimwiX0Si_wSnjmlOHKxs7obsrhnivlfdyGa9TnNegNNBzxcE15jiTmqZEV4VXG1m2f00kzV73Di8_pAoHXVftOyDUJQEJucCKYgS7xGPD8yJ/s1600/AND+gate+race+condition.bmp) |
| **Figure 1: An example digital circuit having race condition** |  |  |  |  |  |
Theoretically, the output will
always be ‘0’. However, this is true only if the non-inverted portion of the
signal has greater delay in reaching the AND gate (we have considered ‘0’ ->
‘1’ transition of the input signal ‘A’). As shown in the figure above, the
signal passing through inverter will have some delay of its own. If the signal
through inverter reaches the AND gate later than the one without inverter,
there will be a glitch as shown in the figure 2. For ‘1’ -> ‘0’ transition,
the opposite will happen.
|     |
| [![The above circuit requires a certain relationship between arrival times of the two signals. If the relationship is not ensured, glith will be caused.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7PnQ-8lxZWzUhh89RAmIqRiosxJnnXHNZ3yD_sgvBDP-IaFaGuWR-6gNMwkpi9fvthYGxPS1tHwuwlbaXhDU0k5zkUHlskXq9mTjKTxuwZUfCxfLflQQlE8zMwEkfrCULnwb30JOJAwcF/s640/race+condition+causing+glitch.bmp)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7PnQ-8lxZWzUhh89RAmIqRiosxJnnXHNZ3yD_sgvBDP-IaFaGuWR-6gNMwkpi9fvthYGxPS1tHwuwlbaXhDU0k5zkUHlskXq9mTjKTxuwZUfCxfLflQQlE8zMwEkfrCULnwb30JOJAwcF/s1600/race+condition+causing+glitch.bmp) |
| **Figure 2: Glitch caused at the output of AND gate due to inverted signal being delayed than non-inverted signal** |
**What**
**can be the consequences**: If the condition for race is violated, the design
may enter an undefined state, the one which might not have been considered
while designing. Hence, the whole system will malfunction in such a scenario
leading to failure. It might be the case that some elements in the design enter
metastable state, which can further cause problems. Hence, it is very important
to give proper consideration to race conditions.
**How**
**can we prevent race condition**: Normally, in digital designs, as long
as setup and hold checks are met for each flip-flop, we do not need to worry
about the race conditions in the design under consideration. But, there are
some conditions like the output of the above AND gate might be used as a clock
for some flop. In that case, we need to consider the race condition. We need to
have proper sequencing of signals so as to have the desired output. Had the
above case been in reality, it might be wise to delay the non-inverted signal. Race
conditions in the design can be eliminated by using proper design techniques (e.g.
K-map). Using these, designers and recognize and eliminate the race conditions
before they cause problems.

### 10. Scan chains – the backbone of DFT

**Date:** 2013-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/scan-chains-backbone-of-dft.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/scan-chains-backbone-of-dft.html)

### Scan chains – the backbone of DFT
**What are scan**
**chains:** Scan chains are the elements in scan-based designs that are used
to shift-in and shift-out test data. A scan chain is formed by a number of
flops connected back to back in a chain with the output of one flop connected
to another. The input of first flop is connected to the input pin of the chip
(called scan-in) from where scan data is fed. The output of the last flop is
connected to the output pin of the chip (called scan-out) which is used to take
the shifted data out. The figure below shows a scan chain.
|     |
| [![A scan chain contains a chain of flops with output of one flop connected directly to input of another flop.

**Purpose of scan**
**chains**: As said above, scan chains are inserted into designs to shift
the test data into the chip and out of the chip. This is done in order to make
every point in the chip controllable and observable as discussed below.
**How normal flop is**
**transformed into a scan flop**: The flops in the design have to be
modified in order to be put in the scan chains. To do so, the normal input (D)
of the flip-flop has to be multiplexed with the scan input. A signal called
scan-enable is used to control which input will propagate to the output.

| **Figure showing transition of a normal flop to scan flop** |
**If scan-enable = 0**,
data at D pin of the flop will propagate to Q at the next active edge
**If scan-enable= 1**,
data present at scan-in input will propagate to Q at the next active edge
**Scan terminology**:
Before we talk further, it will be useful to know some signals used in scan
chains which are as follows:
- **Scan-in:** Input to the flop/scan-chain that is used to provide scan data into it
- **Scan-out:** Output from flop/scan-chain that provides the scanned data to the next
flop/output
- **Scan-enable:** Input to the flop that controls whether scan\_in data or functional
data will propagate to output
**Purpose of testing**
**using scan**: Scan testing is carried out for various reasons, two most
prominent of them are:
- To test stuck-at faults in manufactured devices
- To test the paths in the manufactured devices
for delay; i.e. to test whether each path is working at functional frequency or
not
**How a scan chain**
**functions**: The fundamental goal of scan chains is to make each node in
the circuit controllable and observable through limited number of patterns by
providing a bypass path to each flip-flop. Basically, it follows these steps:
1. Assert scan\_enable (make it high) so as to
enable (SI -> Q) path for each flop
2. Keep shifting in the scan data until the
intended values at intended nodes are reached
3. De-assert scan\_enable (for one pulse of clock in
case of stuck-at testing and two or more cycles in case of transition testing)
to enable D->Q path so that the combinational cloud output can be captured
at the next clock edge.
4. Again assert scan\_enable and shift out the data
through scan\_out
**How Chain length is**
**decided**: By chain length, we mean the number of flip-flops in a single
scan chain. Larger the chain length, more the number of cycles required to
shift the data in and out. However, considering the number of flops remains
same, smaller chain length means more number of input/output ports is needed as
scan\_in and scan\_out ports. As
**Number of ports**
**required = 2 X Number of scan chains**
Since for each scan chain, scan\_in and scan\_out port is needed.
Also,
**Number of cycles**
**required to run a pattern = Length of largest scan chain in design**
Suppose, there are 10000 flops in the design and there are 6
ports available as input/output. This means we can make (6/2=) 3 chains. If we
make scan chains of 9000, 100 and 900 flops, it will be inefficient as 9000
cycles will be required to shift the data in and out. We need to distribute
flops in scan chains almost equally. If we make chain lengths as 3300, 3400 and
3300, the number of cycles required is 3400.
Keeping almost equal number of flops in each scan chain is
referred to as **chain balancing**.

### 11. Data checks : data setup and data hold in VLSI

**Date:** 2013-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/data-to-data-checks-constraining.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/data-to-data-checks-constraining.html)

### Data checks : data setup and data hold in VLSI
Many a times, two or
more signals at analog-digital interface or at the chip interface have some timing requirement with respect to each other. These requirements are generally in the
form of minimum skew and maximum skew. Data checks come to rescue in such
situations. Theoretically speaking, data-to-data checks are applied between two
arbitrary data signals, none of which is a clock. One of these is called
constrained pin, which is like data pin of the flop. The other is called
related pin, which is like clock pin of the flop. In the figure below, is shown
two data signal at a boundary (possibly analog hard macro) having some minimum
skew requirement between them.
|     |
| [![Data to data check is applied between a constrained pin and a related pin. The pins may be of an analog block or chip interface](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg0g_NeC6d__XEGCb_XhLBR1AT6a3FwQCKgZda2dYMe3B5prfwkd3QdsSsja2wqS8N07-FI7zq7gB-F39B7ZjjqVeIBEAYueYpnzPtk0wRJ6e0Zp9mwqxAzkSQ37WZ8kpMazBNdQD49KXOY/s640/data+to+data+checks.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg0g_NeC6d__XEGCb_XhLBR1AT6a3FwQCKgZda2dYMe3B5prfwkd3QdsSsja2wqS8N07-FI7zq7gB-F39B7ZjjqVeIBEAYueYpnzPtk0wRJ6e0Zp9mwqxAzkSQ37WZ8kpMazBNdQD49KXOY/s1600/data+to+data+checks.png) |
| **Figure 1 : Two signals arriving at a boundary**<br>**having skew requirement** |
**Data-to-data checks**
**are zero cycle checks**: An important difference between normal setup
check (between a clock signal and a data signal) and data-to-data checks is
that data-to-data checks are zero cycle checks while normal setupcheck is single cycle check. When we say that
data checks are zero-cycle checks, we mean that these are between two data
signals that have launched at the same clock edge with respect to each other.
As shown in the figure (i) below, traditional setup check is
between a data signal launched at one clock edge and a clock. Since, the data
is launched at one clock edge and is checked with respect to one edge later, it
is a single cycle check. On the other hand, as shown in figure (ii),
data-to-data check is between two signals both of which are launched on the
same clock edge. Hence, we can saydata-to-data checks are zero cycle checks.

| **Figure 2 : (i) Normal setup check between a**<br>**data signal and a clock signal, (ii) Data to dat setup check between two data**<br>**signals** |
**What command in EDA**
**tools is used to model data-to-data checks**: Data checks are
modeled in EDA tools using ‘ _set\_data\_check’_ command.
**_Set\_data\_check –from A –to B –setup <x>_**
**_Set\_data\_check –from A –to B –hold <y>_**
Here, A is the related pin and B is the constrained pin. The
first command constrains B to toggle at least ‘x’ time before ‘A’. Second command
constrains ‘B’ to toggle at least ‘y’ time after ‘A’.
Data setup time and data hold time: Similar to setup time and hold time, we can define data setup time and data hold time as follows:
- **Definition of data setup time**: Data setup time can be defined as the minimum time before the toggling of reference signal for which constrained signal should become stable. In the example above, <x> is data setup time.
- **Definition of data hold time**: Data hold time can be defined as the minimum time after the toggling of reference signal for which constrained signal should remain stable. In the example above, <y> is data hold time.
Modeling
data-to-data checks through liberty file: We can model data checks through .lib also. There are constructs that can be used to model
data-to-data checks. These are **non\_seq\_setup\_rising**, **non\_seq\_setup\_falling**,
**non\_seq\_hold\_rising** and **non\_seq\_hold\_falling**. These commands specify setup and
hold data-to-data checks with respect to rising or falling edge of reference
signal respectively. E.g. ‘non\_seq\_setup\_falling’ represents data setup check with respect to falling edge of reference
signal. ‘rise\_constraint’ and ‘fall\_constraint’ can be used inside these to
model the setup and hold checks for rising and falling edge of constrained
signal. Figure 3 below shows an example of modeling data setup check through liberty file.

| **Figure 3 : Modeling data-to-data checks**<br>**through .lib using non\_seq\_setup\_rising** |
**In which cases**
**data-to-data checks are applied**: Data checks are normally
applied where there is a specific requirement of skew (either minimum of
maximum) or race condition (where the order of arrival of two signals can affect output and the intention is to get one of the probable outputs by constraining one signal to come before the other) between two or more signals. These may be required where:
- At the digital-analog interface within a chip
where analog signals at the analog block boundary are required in a specific
order
- At the chip boundary, some asynchronous interface
signals may have skew requirements
**How data checks are useful**: As we have seen above, data checks provide a
convenient measure to constrain two or more data signals with respect to each
other. Had these checks not been there, it would have been a manual effort to
check the skew between the two arriving signals and to maintain it. Also, it
would not have been possible to get the optimization done through
implementation tool as these would not have been constrained for it.

Why do we have an option of -clock for the set\_data\_check when this check is an asynch check ?

Hi
It is a misconception that data\_check is an asynchronous check. It is simply a check between two data signals. We can only constrain two signals, if there is a relation between them.
As regards -clock option is concerned, the two signals in question can be launched by multiple clocks. This option is just to choose right clock between them.

### Clock latency
**Definition of clock latency (clock insertion delay)**: In
sequential designs, each timing path is triggered by a clock signal that
originates from a source. The flops being triggered by the clock signal are
known as sinks for the clock. In general, **clock**
**latency (or clock insertion delay) is defined as the amount of time taken by the clock signal in**
**traveling from its source to the sinks**. Clock latency comprises of two
components - clock source latency and clock network latency.
- **Source**
**latency of clock (Source insertion delay)**: Source latency is defined as the time taken by the clock signal in traversing from clock
source (may be PLL, oscillator or some other source) to the clock definition
point. It is also known as source insertion delay. It can be used to model
off-chip clock latency when clock source is not part of the chip itself.
#### - **Network**   **latency of clock (Network insertion delay)**: Network latency is defined as the time taken by the clock signal in traversing from clock   definition point to the sinks of the clock. Thus, each sink of the clock has a different network latency. If we talk about the clock, it will have:   - Maximum network latency: Maximum of all the network latencies   - Minimum network latency: Minimum of all the network latencies   - Average network latency: Average of all the network latencies
Total clock latency is given as the sum of source latency and network latency. In other words, total clock latency at a point is given as follows:
**Clock latency = Source latency + Network latency**
It
is generally stated that for a robust clock tree, ‘ **sum of source latency and network latency for all sinks of a clock**
**should be equal’.** If that is the case, the clock tree is said to be
balanced as this means that all the registers are getting clock at the same time; i.e., clock skew is zero.

Network latency is the time taken by clock from its root to the sink.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-8zP1jyBdCtKshFGzE9dosDpuT8eVTQJRjEPN9KMqGJFXQQveMu8gi7lAhuTTGexa7oBtHWiTb6dkKbzCOu9ro6SlzyzxVZ2DWRRqaCa96GRYcTIgWnLLJhcDjt8I_UTiNWfPp_3vkyPC/s640/source+latency+and+network+latency.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-8zP1jyBdCtKshFGzE9dosDpuT8eVTQJRjEPN9KMqGJFXQQveMu8gi7lAhuTTGexa7oBtHWiTb6dkKbzCOu9ro6SlzyzxVZ2DWRRqaCa96GRYcTIgWnLLJhcDjt8I_UTiNWfPp_3vkyPC/s1600/source+latency+and+network+latency.png) |
| **Figure 1 : Figure showing source**<br>**latency and network latency components of clock latency** |
Figure
1 above shows the two components of clock latency, i.e. source latency and
network latency. Each flop (sink, in general) has its own latency since the
path traced by clock from source to it may be different. The above case may be
found in block level constraints in case of hierarchical designs wherein clock
source is sitting outside the block and clock signal enters the block through a
block port. It may also represent a case of a chip in which the clock source is
sitting outside; e.g. some external device is controlling the chip. In that
case, clock source will be sitting inside that device.
**How to specify clock latency**: In
EDA tools, we can model clock latency using SDC command ‘set\_clock\_latency’ to
imitate the behavior there will be after clock tree will be built. Using this
command, we can specify both the source latency for a clock as well as the
network latency. After clock tree has been built, the latency for the sinks is
calculated by the tool itself from the delays of various elements. However, in
case the clock source is sitting outside, it still needs to be modeled by
source latency even after the clock tree synthesis. To specify clock latency
for clock signal named ‘ **CLK**’, we may
use SDC command **set\_clock\_latency**:
**set\_clock\_latency <value> CLK**
**set\_clock\_latency**
**<value> CLK –source**
First
command will specify the network latency whereas the second command will
specify the source latency for **CLK**.

Here's my thought, I think either way may have its trade-off.
High skew and low latency:
\- High clock skew may cause challenges in timing closure.
\- Low latency will increase speed for data output, which could be good for performance.
Low skew and high latency:
   -Low skew is generally optimal for timing closure.
   -But, high latency may decrease speed for data output, which results in low performance.
That's what I have thought!
Feel free to correct and provide different point of view if any.

Hi Kevin, i believe you are misinterpreting the latency here. Here, latency refers to clock insertion delay, not the architectural latency. High latency will cause more power and uncommon, and in a way, would contribute to skew as well.

Hi Glittering code, yes. I have misunderstood the concept on the data latency and clock latency. Thanks for providing the insight.

### 13. Controllability and observability - basics of DFT

**Date:** 2013-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/controllability-and-observability-two.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/controllability-and-observability-two.html)

### Controllability and observability - basics of DFT
**What DFT is meant**
**for**: Design for Testability (DFT) is basically meant for providing a method
for testing each and every node in the design for structural and other faults.
Higher the number of nodes which can be tested through the targeted number of
patterns, greater is the test coverage of the design. For this to be possible,
every node in the design has to be controllable and observable. But what is
controllability and observability? We can consider these as the two basic
principles of DFT which are to be followed in order to have the maximum test
coverage possible through minimum number of patterns. Let us discuss these.
**Controllability**:
By controllability from DFT point of view, we intend if both ‘0’ and ‘1’ are able
to propagate to each and every node within the target patterns. A point is said to be controllable if both ‘0’
and ‘1’ can be propagated through scan patterns.
**What if a node is**
**not controllable**: To achieve DFT coverage for a node, it is needed to
be controllable. If a node is not controllable, it cannot be tested. For
production mode devices, it is necessary to have certain minimum percentage of
nodes controllable to ensure reliable devices to the customers. So, less number
of controllable nodes mean less DFT coverage, and hence, less reliable devices.
|     |
| [![Figure representing a case where a node has a large combinational cloud at the input resulting in the node being not controllable. This is because wither 0 or 1 may not be able to propagate to the node through specified number of patterns.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLjw2uMINsFR5G2pDgC7wyhdZlQkOUk2_cGbWOAq8QX7C35XZCKiKPzHO1n4bNCYJ1aoR1lY4KkvX8ECrwXCAEJ_X3uewTuqHLyrbjxRSlTdYAEbmeJv9c_ukDoXqK2u3GQyVSBIyisb6R/s640/not+controllable+node.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLjw2uMINsFR5G2pDgC7wyhdZlQkOUk2_cGbWOAq8QX7C35XZCKiKPzHO1n4bNCYJ1aoR1lY4KkvX8ECrwXCAEJ_X3uewTuqHLyrbjxRSlTdYAEbmeJv9c_ukDoXqK2u3GQyVSBIyisb6R/s1600/not+controllable+node.png) |
| **Figure 1 : Figure showing a node that**<br>**is not controllable within targetted number of patterns** |
**Inserting control**
**points (enhancing controllability)**: A node can be made controllable by
inserting control points. If the test coverage target is not getting met
through target number of patterns, control points are inserted to increase the
test coverage. A control point is an alternate path supplied to a node to let a
particular value propagate to it. As shown in figure1, NODEA is not
controllable within targeted number of patterns. We need to insert a control
point in order to increase its controllability. As shown in figure2, an
alternate path can be provided to NODEA controlled by enable signal. Adding
control point at NODEA not only improves the controllability of NODEA, but it
also improves the controllability of fanout cone of NODEA.

| [![Control point can be inserted to make a point controllable. A control point provieds a direct controllable path to the node so as to let propagate the desired value to the desired node.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVln0j69kt4Rxkcf3MP4gLB7lhyqrCbdpgZ9h59JIkBfMYY1wDmIvOgW5LPXAPk3S1CeCUHhlmXli9RBM4PkEa82oFpMUkknsNc4jmuyAFcqWF4XtRU8K2ASAAlK-qJ9ExrnM49SKvx4QK/s640/controllability+improved+by+adding+control+point.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVln0j69kt4Rxkcf3MP4gLB7lhyqrCbdpgZ9h59JIkBfMYY1wDmIvOgW5LPXAPk3S1CeCUHhlmXli9RBM4PkEa82oFpMUkknsNc4jmuyAFcqWF4XtRU8K2ASAAlK-qJ9ExrnM49SKvx4QK/s1600/controllability+improved+by+adding+control+point.png) |
| **Figure 2 : Inserting control point to**<br>**enhance controllability** |
       There can be three types of control points:
- **‘0’**
**control points** – Suppose we were earlier able to propagate ‘1’ to NODEA. We
only need to let ‘0’ propagate. In that case, we can add a ‘0’ control point
- **‘1’**
**control points**\- Suppose we were earlier able to propagate ‘0’ to NODEA. We
only need to let ‘1’ propagate. In that case, we can add a ‘0’ control point
- **Flop**
**control points –** In order to let propagate both ‘0’ and ‘1’ through control
points, flops need to be inserted.
In case of ‘0’ and ‘1’ control points, the control input of
mux can be tied to ‘0’ or ‘1’. Hence, area overhead is only a mux. On the other
hand, flop control points come with an overhead of an extra flop.
**Observability**:
By observability, we mean out ability to measure the state of a logic signal. When
we say that a node is observable, we mean that the value at the node can be
shifted out through scan patterns and can be observed through scan out ports.
**What if a node is**
**not observable**: If a node is not observable, it means we cannot see the
value at the node and it is not possible to see the value at that node through
targeted number of patterns. To have scan coverage for the node, it is
necessary to be observable. As in the case of less number of controllable
nodes, if number of observable nodes is less, it means less scan coverage. So,
less number of observable nodes also means less reliable devices. There may be
many cases in which we cannot observe a node. The most common are the nodes
connected to inputs of an analog block not having a scan chain inside. Since,
analog blocks do not have scan chains, the input nodes cannot be observed in
the normal scenario which renders the entire fanin logic unobserved.

| **Figure 3: Figure showing a non-observable node** |  |  |
**How a node can be**
**made observable**: To improve the observability of nodes in the design,
observe points are inserted. An observe point is a flip-flop inserted in the
design that observes the value at one or more point. It has no functional
purpose. It is inserted in the scan chain and shifts the observed data to scan
out ports through scan shifting. A flip flop inserted as observe point can be
used to observe a large number of hard-to-detect faults which results in a
significant reduction in pattern count.

### 14. Analog to Digital Converter

**Date:** 2013-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/analog-to-digital-converter.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/analog-to-digital-converter.html)

### Analog to Digital Converter
In real world, all signals like
light, sound etc, are analog signals. These signals have to be
converted into digital form so that they can be manipulated by
digital equipment. Device used to convert analog signal into digital
signal is called Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). An example of an analog to digital converter is a Scanner –
It takes a picture (analog) as input and convert into digital picture. ADC is
an electrical circuit that converts continuous time and continuous
amplitude signal into discrete time and discrete amplitude signal.
Let us first discuss basic concept of
analog to digital conversion. The process of digitizing the domain(time)
is called **sampling** and the process of digitizing
range(voltage/current) is called **quantization**.
**Sampling**
: An ADC circuit samples analog signal from time to time. Then, each sample is converted into a number based on its voltage level.
The frequency at which sampling occurs is called sampling rate or
sampling frequency. e.g if sampling frequency is 22000 Hz, it means, in
one second 22000 input points will be sampled and distance between
two adjacent time points is 1/22000 seconds. Higher the sampling
frequency, more perfect will be the analog signal produced by DAC
(when it is required to reconstruct the analog signal from digital
samples). But more memory will be needed to store these samples. So
there is always a trade off between memory required to store samples
and accuracy of signal. But to reproduce analog signal from digital
samples, there should be some minimum number of samples. And
According to **Nyquist sampling**
**theorem,** sampling rate must be at least twice the highest
frequency component to avoid aliasing.
                                      Fs = 2Fmax
**Quantization**: Quantization is the process of converting continuous value signal
into discrete value signal so that signal takes only finite set of
values. Unlike sampling (where we saw that under some conditions, it is
possible to reconstruct the signal), quantization results in some
loss of information called quantization error. One of basic choice in
quantization is the number of discrete quantization levels to use.
Fundamental tradeoff in this choice is the resulting signal quality
vs data(bits) needed to represent each sample. With L levels, number
of bits required to represent each level,
              N = logL/log2.

| **Analog to Digital Converter with 32 levels(5 bits)** | |
**Some Important Terms**:
**Range(E****FSR****)**: Range of ADC circuit is the difference between highest and
lowest input voltage the ADC device can take in as input.
EFSR = V**max**
\- V**min**
**Resolution**
– Resolution of ADC is defined as minimum change in input analog
voltage to guarantee a change in output code level.
                 Resolution of ADC, Q = EFSR /
(2N – 1) where,
                 N = Number of bits
Higher the number of bits, lesser is
the resolution and higher is accuracy.
For Example,
Let us say Range of ADC is 10 V and number of bits are 5; hence, total number of voltage levels are 32. Each level represents/resolution is  10/32 =  0.3125 V; i.e., any change is input voltage less than 0.3125 won't result in any change in output.
Flash ADC( _named because of its high speed_) : Flash ADC is
also known as direct conversion ADC. It uses linear voltage ladder with
comparator at each step of ladder to compare input analog voltage to
successive reference voltage. Often, this comparator ladder requires
many resistors. For an N-bit converter, 2N \- 1 comparators are
required. Reference voltage for each comparator is one least significant
bit greater than its preceding comparator. Each comparator produces
result 1 if analog voltage is greater than reference voltage. It means
if input voltage is between Vx4 and Vx5, then, comparators 0-4 produces
1 and remaining comparators produces 0.
From Here, we can also say that resolution of ADC is difference
between reference voltages of two adjacent comparators.

### 15. Setup checks and hold checks for flop-to-flop paths

**Date:** 2013-07
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/setup-and-hold-checks-static-timing.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/07/setup-and-hold-checks-static-timing.html)

### Setup checks and hold checks for flop-to-flop paths
In
the post ( [Setup time and hold time – static timing analysis](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2013/06/setup-and-hold-basics-of-timing-analysis.html)), we introduced setup and
hold timing requirements and also discussed why these requirements exist. In this post, we will be discussing how these checks are applied
for different cases for paths starting from and ending at flip-flops.
In
present day designs, most of the paths (more than 95%) start from and end at
flip-flops (exceptions are there like paths starting from and/or ending at
latches). There can be flops which are positive edge triggered or negative edge
triggered. Thus, depending upon the type of launching flip-flop and capturing
flip-flop, there can be 4 cases as discussed below:
**1)** **Setup**
**and hold checks for paths launching from positive edge-triggered flip-flop and**
**being captured at positive edge-triggered flip-flop (rise-to-rise checks)** **:** Figure 1 shows a
path being launched from a positive edge-triggered flop and being captured on a
positive edge-triggered flop. In this case, setup check is on the next rising
edge and hold check is on the same edge corresponding to the clock edge on
which launching flop is launching the data.

| **Figure 1 : Timing path from positive**<br>**edge flop to positive edge flop (rise to rise path)** |
Figure 2 below shows the setup and hold checks for positive edge-triggered register to positive edge-triggered register in the form of waveform. As is shown,
setup check occurs at the next rising edge and hold check occurs at the same
edge corresponding to the launch clock edge. For this case setup timing equation cab be given as:
**Tck->q**
**\+ Tprop \+ Tsetup < Tperiod** **\+ Tskew** **(for setup check)**
And the equation for hold timing can be given as:
**Tck->q** **\+ Tprop \> Thold \+ Tskew(for**
**hold check)**
Where
Tck->q  : Clock-to-output delay of launch register
Tprop : Maximum delay of the combinational path between launch and capture register
       Thold : Hold time requirement of capturing register
Tskew : skew between the two registers (Clock arrival at capture register - Clock arrival at launch register)

Also, we show below the
data valid and invalid windows. From this figure,
**Data valid window = Clock period**
**– Setup window – Hold window**
**Start of data valid window = Tlaunch**
**\+ Thold**
**End of data valid window = Tlaunch**
**\+ Tperiod – Tsetup**
In other words, data at the input of capture register can toggle any time between ( **Tlaunch \+ Thold**) and ( **Tlaunch \+ Tperiod – Tsetup**).

| **Figure 3: Figure showing data valid**<br>**window for rise-to-rise path** |
**2)** **Setup**
**and hold checks for paths launching from positive edge-triggered flip-flop and**
**being captured at negative edge-triggered flip-flop** **:** In this case, both
setup and hold check are half cycle checks; setup being checked on the next
falling edge at the capture flop and hold on the previous falling edge of clock
at the capture flop (data is launched at rising edge). Thus, with respect to
(case 1) above, setup check has become tight and hold check has relaxed.

The interpretation of this case is similar to case 1. Both launch and
capture of data happen at negative edge of the clock. Figure 10 shows a path
being launched from a negative edge-triggered flop and being captured on a
negative edge-triggered flop. In this case, setup check is on the next falling
edge and hold check is on the same edge corresponding to the clock edge on
which launching flop is launching the data.

Hi
It is clock latency at the launch flip-flop.

This is because capture edge where hold is being checked is T/2 time behind launch edge.

for posedgeflop to negedge flop, why is it half cycle for setup check? and not 1.5cycle? I was using the logic from this https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2018/07/is-hold-always-checked-on-same-edge.html
launch at first posedge (stage k), the k+1 on negative edge doesn't occur until 1.5cycle isn't it?

Hi Vignesh
Good question, that actually meant that if both edges are involved in a timing check, then count each edge (either positive or negative as 1); This essentially makes the next negative edge k+1th edge. Can you read it again and let me know. If it does not make sense, can you suggest edits to that post for the benefit of others. Thanks a lot for your feedback. :-)

Why is the launch edge shown on next state for positive to positive while it is on the current edge for positive to negative FF?
Though you show the launch edge on the next edge for a Positive to positive FF, your data validity window in written with respect to the edge on which hold is checked(K). Why?

Static timing analysis always checks worst cases.
Positive to positive : Launch on Kth edge. capture should be on next rise edge. so K+1. From clock period perspective you are getting complete cycle
Positive to negative : these are 2 different edges. from clock perspective you get only half cycle. So launch and capture happen in same cycle but different edges.

### 16. Setup time and hold time basics

**Date:** 2013-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/06/setup-and-hold-basics-of-timing-analysis.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/06/setup-and-hold-basics-of-timing-analysis.html)

### Setup time and hold time basics
In digital designs, each and
every flip-flop has some restrictions related to the data with respect to the
clock in the form of windows in which data can change or not. There is always a
region around the clock edge in which input data should not change at the input
of the flip-flop. This is because, if the data changes within this window, we
cannot guarantee the output. The output can be the result of either of the
previous input, the new input or metastability (as explained in our post  ' [metastability](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2013/02/metastability.html)').
This window is marked by two boundary lines, one pertaining to the setup time
of the flop, the other to the hold time defined as below.
> **Definition of Setup**
> **time**: Setup time is defined as the minimum amount of time before the clock's
> active edge that the data must be stable for it to be latched correctly. In other words, each flip-flop (or any sequential element, in general) needs some time for the data to remain stable before the clock edge arrives, such that it can reliably capture the data. This duration is known as **setup time**.
> The data that was launched at the previous clock edge should be stable at the input at least setup time before the clock edge. So, adherence to setup time ensures that the data launched at previous edge is captured properly at the current edge. In other words, we can also say that setup time adherence ensures that the system moves to next state smoothly.
> **Definition of Hold time**:
> Hold time is defined as the minimum amount of time after the clock's active
> edge during which data must be stable. Similar to setup time, each sequential element needs some time for data to remain stable after clock edge arrives to reliably capture data. This duration is known as **hold time**.
> The data that was launched at the current edge should not travel to the capturing flop before hold time has passed after the clock edge. Adherence to hold time ensures that the data launched at current clock edge does not get captured at the same edge. In other words, hold time adherence ensures that system does not deviate from the current state and go into an invalid state.
As shown
in the figure 1 below, the data at the input of flip-flop can change anywhere except within the seup time hold time window.

| **A D-type latch** |
**Cause/origin of setup time and hold time**: Setup time and hold time are said to be the backbone of timing analysis. Rightly so, for the chip to function properly, setup and hold timing constraints need to be met properly for each and every flip-flop in the design. If even a single flop exists that does not meet setup and hold requirements for timing paths starting from/ending at it, the design will fail and meta-stability will occur. It is very important to understand the origin of setup time and hold time as whole design functionality is ensured by these. Let us discuss the origin of setup time and hold time taking an example of D-flip-flop as in VLSI designs, D-type flip-flops are almost always used. A D-type flip-flop is realized using two D-type latches; one of them is positive level-sensitive, the other is negative level-sensitive. A D-type latch, in turn, is realized using transmission gates and inverters. Figure below shows a positive-level sensitive D-type latch. Just inverting the transmission gates’ clock, we get negative-level sensitive D-type latch.
A complete D flip-flop using the above structure of D-type latch is shown in figure below:
|     |
| [![ A D-type flip-flop consists of two latches connected back to back in master-slave format](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQk_-EMEkwtrxYeO6TaxnRPlv_0X-QswefGl_vzWvilICWdzID5mXhQwwhOZdtQ8Pq65xFdbxzuLUGMQkzFVsGLSn74wpkHKoHP42nQmN9aaDtNh3X2uNJ7nNVs3UN-AsctF5L-2uUoCPs/s640/D+flip+flop.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQk_-EMEkwtrxYeO6TaxnRPlv_0X-QswefGl_vzWvilICWdzID5mXhQwwhOZdtQ8Pq65xFdbxzuLUGMQkzFVsGLSn74wpkHKoHP42nQmN9aaDtNh3X2uNJ7nNVs3UN-AsctF5L-2uUoCPs/s1600/D+flip+flop.png) |
| **A D-type flip-flop** |
Now, let us get into the details of above figure. For data to be latched by ‘latch 1’ at the falling edge of the clock, it must be present at ‘Node F’ at that time. Since, data has to travel **‘NodeA’ -> ‘Node B’ -> ‘Node C’ -> ‘Node D’ -> ‘Node E’ -> ‘Node F’** to reach ‘Node F’, it should arrive at flip-flop’s input (Node A) at some earlier time. This time for data to reach from ‘Node A’ to ‘Node F’ is termed as data setup time (assuming CLK and CLK' are present instantaneously. If that is not the case, it will be accounted for accordingly). Similarly, it is necessary to ensure a stable value at the input to ensure a stable value at ‘ **Node C**’. In other words, hold time can be termed as delay taken by data from **‘Node A’ to ‘Node C’**.
**Setup and hold checks in a design**: Basically, setup and hold
timing checks ensure that a data launched from one flop is captured at another
properly. Considering the way digital designs of today are designed (finite
state machines), the next state is derived from its previous state. So, data launched at one edge should be
captured at next active clock edge. Also, the data launched from one flop
should not be captured at next flop at the same edge. These conditions are
ensured by setup and hold checks. Setup check ensures that the data is stable
before the setup requirement of next active clock edge at the next flop so that
next state is reached. Similarly, hold check ensures that data is stable until
the hold requirement for the next flop for same clock edge has been met so that
present state is not corrupted.

| **A sample path in a design** |
Shown
above is a flop-to-flop timing path. For simplicity, we have assumed that both the
flops are rise edge triggered. The setup and hold timing relations for the data
at input of second flop can be explained using the waveforms below:
|     |
| [![waveform showing setup and hold requirement for the sample timing path shown above](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2-pqvKvVB0wPB6NsEg2DLGMfCaBOxt2i3ZEfQy0Pf9EN7dnJ1Y6XzGNKk7Dqf_Q8CpZLjm7JbRaNCgrZk6kPqIpTJOhXibFCkfdFSFrTiPFhMVp6YSLj0iLPhs2CarFSaSUUFhTqCU32B/s640/setup+and+hold+timing+checks.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2-pqvKvVB0wPB6NsEg2DLGMfCaBOxt2i3ZEfQy0Pf9EN7dnJ1Y6XzGNKk7Dqf_Q8CpZLjm7JbRaNCgrZk6kPqIpTJOhXibFCkfdFSFrTiPFhMVp6YSLj0iLPhs2CarFSaSUUFhTqCU32B/s1600/setup+and+hold+timing+checks.png) |
| **Figure showing setup and hold checks being applied for the timing path shown above** |
As shown,
data launched from launching flop is allowed to arrive at the input of the
second flop only after a delay greater than its hold requirement so that it is
properly captured. Similarly, it must not have a delay greater than (clock
period – setup requirement of second flop). In other words, mathematically
speaking, setup check equation is given as below (assuming zero skew between
launch and capture clocks):
**Tck->q**
**\+ Tprop \+ Tsetup < Tperiod**
Similarly,
hold check equation is given as:
**Tck->q** **\+ Tprop >** **Thold**
If we
take into account skews between the two clocks, the above equations are
modified accordingly. If Tskew is the skew between launch and
capture flops, (equal to latency of clock at capture flop minus latency of
clock at launch flop so that skew is positive if capture flop has larger
latency and vice-versa), above equations are modified as below:

[Setup checks and hold checks for reg-to-reg paths](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2013/07/setup-and-hold-checks-static-timing.html) explains different cases covering setup and hold checks for flop-to-flop paths.
**What if setup and/or hold violations**
**occur in a design**:
As said earlier, setup and hold timings are to be met in order to ensure that
data launched from one flop is captured properly at the next flop at next clock
edge so as to transfer the state-machine of the design to the next state. If
the setup check is violated, the data will not be captured at the next clock edge
properly. Similarly, if hold check is violated, data intended to be captured at the next edge will get captured at the same edge. Setup hold violations can also lead to data changing within setup/hold window of the capturing flip-flop. It may lead to metastability failure in the design (as explained in our post ' [metastability](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2013/02/metastability.html)'). So, it is necessary to have setup and hold requirements met for
all the flip-flops in the design and there should not be any setup/hold violation.
> **What if you fabricate a design without taking care of setup/hold violations**: If you fabricate a design having setup violations, you can still use it by lowering the frequency as the equation involves the variable clock frequency. On the other hand, a design with hold violation cannot be run properly. So, if you fabricate a design with an accidental hold violation, you will have to simply throw away the chip (unless the hold path is half cycle as explained [here](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2015/04/can-hold-be-frequency-dependant.html)). A design with half cycle hold violations only can still be used at lower frequencies.
**Tackling setup time violation**: As given above, the equation for setup timing check is given as:
**Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup \- Tskew < Tperiod**
The parameter that represents if there is a setup time violation is **setup slack**. The setup slack can be defined as the difference between the L.H.S and R.H.S. In other words, it is the margin that is available such that the timing path meets setup check. The setup slack equation can be given as:
**Setup slack =****Tperiod** **\-  (Tck->q \+ Tprop \+ Tsetup \- Tskew**)
If setup slack is positive, it means there is still some margin available in the timing path. On the other hand, a negative slack means that the paths violates setup timing check by the amount of setup slack. To get the path met, either data delay should be decreased or clock period should be increased.
**Mitigating setup violation**: Thus, we
can meet the setup requirement, if violating, by
1\. Decreasing
clk->q delay of launching flop
2\. Decreasing
the propagation delay of the combinational cloud
3\. Reducing
the setup time requirement of capturing flop
4\. Increasing
the skew between capture and launch clocks
5\. Increasing
the clock period
**Tackling hold time violation**: Similarly, the equation for hold timing check is as below:
**Tck->q** **\+ Tprop** **\> Thold \+ Tskew**
The parameter that represents if there is a hold timing violation is **hold slack**. The hold slack is defined as the amount by which L.H.S is greater than R.H.S. In other words, it is the margin by which timing path meets the hold timing check. The equation for hold slack is given as:
**Hold slack = Tck->q** **\+ Tprop -** **Thold \- Tskew**
If hold slack is positive, it means there is still some margin available before it will start violating for hold. A negative hold slack means the path is violating hold timing check by the amount represented by hold slack. To get the path met, either data path delay should be increased, or clock skew/hold requirement of capturing flop should be decreased.
**Mitigating hold violation**: We can
meet the hold requirement by:
1. Increasing
the clk->q delay of launching flop
2. Decreasing
the hold requirement of capturing flop
3. Decreasing
clock skew between capturing clock and launching flip-flops

Yes, setup and hold can be independently negative, but the sum of setup and hold should be always positive.

If we dont do timing analysis, then we wouldnt know that what paths are likely to fail setup/hold in silicon. And we wouldnt be able to fix those paths. In essence, no chip will ever be functional in that case.

### 17. Lockup latch – principle, application and timing

**Date:** 2013-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/06/lockup-latches-soul-mate-of-scan-based.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/06/lockup-latches-soul-mate-of-scan-based.html)

### Lockup latch – principle, application and timing
**What are lock-up latches**: Lock-up
latch is an important element in scan-based designs, especially for
hold timing closure of shift modes. Lock-up latches are necessary to avoid skew
problems during shift phase of scan-based testing. A lock-up latch is nothing
more than a transparent latch used intelligently in the places where clock skew
is very large and meeting hold timing is a challenge due to large uncommon
clock path. That is why, lockup latches are used to connect two flops in scan
chain having excessive clock skews/uncommon clock paths as the probability of
hold failure is high in such cases. For instances, the launching and capturing
flops may belong to two different domains (as shown in figure below).
Functionally, they might not be interacting. Hence, the clock of these two
domains will not be balanced and will have large uncommon path. But in
scan-shift mode, these interact shifting the data in and out. Had there been no
lockup latches, it would have been very difficult for STA engineer to close
timing in a scan chain across domains. Also, probability of chip failure would
have been high as there a large uncommon path between the clocks of the two
flops leading to large on-chip-variations. That is why; lockup latches can be referred as as the soul mate of scan-based designs.

| [![Lockup latches are needed where there is need to fix hold due to large skew between clock signals for launch and capture flops](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuXQ4KEZT4trwkHu0DpGIaq6VYDrwhziWxhH9imH53l3yz_XPVUvB0xRs-2eg3WR-IFoEaH3ucTvOP69Pw_Dyuub17YBhYz8A3FbtbGrpNaE_2fIj7TvFbIfA5fp8vaB85vyoWHuGc03xC/s640/lockup+latch+in+a+path+failing+due+to+large+skew.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuXQ4KEZT4trwkHu0DpGIaq6VYDrwhziWxhH9imH53l3yz_XPVUvB0xRs-2eg3WR-IFoEaH3ucTvOP69Pw_Dyuub17YBhYz8A3FbtbGrpNaE_2fIj7TvFbIfA5fp8vaB85vyoWHuGc03xC/s1600/lockup+latch+in+a+path+failing+due+to+large+skew.png) |
| **Figure 1 : Lockup latches - the soul**<br>**mate of scan-based designs** |
**Where to use a lock-up**
**latch**: As mentioned above, a lock-up latch is used where
there is high probability of hold failure in scan-shift modes. So, possible
scenarios where lockup latches are to be inserted are:
- **Scan**
**chains from different clock domains:** In this case, since, the
two domains do not interact functionally, so both the clock skew and uncommon
clock path will be large.
- **Flops**
**within same domain, but at remote places:** Flops within a
scan chain which are at remote places are likely to have more uncommon clock
path.
In both the above mentioned cases, there is a great
chance that the skew between the launch and capture clocks will be high. There
is both the probability of launch and capture clocks having greater latency. If
the capture clock has greater latency than launch clock, then the hold check
will be as shown in timing diagram in figure 3. If the skew difference is large, it will be a
tough task to meet the hold timing without lockup latches.

| **Figure**<br>**3: Timing diagram showing setup and**<br>**hold checks for path crossing from domain 1 to domain 2** |
**Positive or negative level**
**latch??** It depends on the path you are inserting a
lock-up latch. Since, lock-up latches are inserted for hold timing; these are not
needed where the path starts at a positive edge-triggered flop and ends at a
negative edge-triggered flop. It is to be noted that you will never find scan paths originating at positive edge-triggered flop and ending at negative edge-triggered flop due to DFT specific reasons. Similarly, these are not needed where path starts
at a negative edge-triggered flop and ends at a positive edge-triggered flop.
For rest two kinds of flop-to-flop paths, lockup latches are required. The
polarity of the lockup latch needs to be such that it remains open during the
inactive phase of the clock. Hence,
- **For flops triggering on positive edge**
**of the clock**, you need to have latch transparent when
clock is low ( **negative level-sensitive**
**lockup latch**)
- **For flops triggering on negative edge**
**of the clock**, you need to have latch transparent when
clock is high ( **positive level-sensitive lockup**
**latch**)
**Who inserts a lock-up latch**:
These days, tools exist that automatically add lockup latches where a scan
chain is crossing domains. However, for cases where a lockup latch is to be
inserted in an intra-domain scan chain (i.e. for flops having uncommon path),
it has to be inserted during physical implementation itself as physical
information is not feasible during scan chain implementation (scan chain
implementation is carried out at the synthesis stage itself).
**Which clock should be**
**connected to lock-up latch**: There are two possible
ways in which we can connect the clock pin of the lockup latch inserted. It can
either have same clock as launching flop or capturing flop. Connecting the
clock pin of lockup latch to clock of capturing flop will not solve the problem
as discussed below.
- **Lock-up latch and capturing**
**flop having the same clock (Will not solve the problem)**: In
this case, the setup and hold checks will be as shown in figure 5. As is
apparent from the waveforms, the hold check between domain1 flop and lockup
latch is still the same as it was between domain 1 flop and domain 2 flop before.
So, this is not the correct way to insert lockup latch.

| **Figure**<br>**5: Timing diagrams for figure 4** |
- **Lock-up latch and launching**
**flop having the same clock**: As shown in figure 7,
connecting the lockup latch to launch flop’s clock causes the skew to reduce
between the domain1 flop and lockup latch. This hold check can be easily met as
both skew and uncommon clock path is low. The hold check between lockup latch
and domain2 flop is already relaxed as it is half cycle check. So, we can say
that the correct way to insert a lockup latch is to insert it closer to

**Why don’t we add buffers**: If
the clock skew is large at places, it will take a number of buffers to meet
hold requirement. In normal scenario, the number of buffers will become so
large that it will become a concern for power and area. Also, since
skew/uncommon clock path is large, the variation due to OCV will be high. So,
it is recommended to have a bigger margin for hold while signing it off for
timing. Lock-up latch provides an area and power efficient solution for what a
number of buffers together will not be able to achieve.
**Advantages of inserting**
**lockup latches**:
- Inserting lock-up latches helps in easier hold
timing closure for scan-shift mode
- Robust
method of hold timing closure where uncommon path is high between launch and
capture flops
- Power efficient and area efficient
- It improves yield as it enables the device
to handle more variations.
**Lockup registers:** Instead of latches, registers can also be used as lockup elements; however, they have their own advantages and disadvantages. Please refer to [Lockup latches vs. lockup registers : what to chose](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2016/08/lockup-latches-vs-lockup-flops.html) for a comparative study of using lockup latches vs lockup registers.

    Do we need to insert lockup latches in case capturing clock is built at lesser latency?

    As mentioned above, there are two cases in which lockup latches need to be inserted - skew and uncommon path. If we consider ideal scenario, there should not be the need. However, due to on-chip variations, the variation in launch and capture path may be very large. So, if launch and capture path have large uncommon path, even if the capture flop is built at lesser latency; in real silicon scenario, it may exceed the latency of launch clock path. Hence, it is better if we have a lockup latch for better yield.

    The clock of launch and capture registers of interacting timing paths normally starts from a common source. However, depending upon the placement and clock path logic, it has to branch out somewhere. Till the point where it branches out is common clock path. And afterwards, it is said to be uncommon clock path. I hope I am making sense.

    Hi,
    Why lockup latch is not necessary where the path starts at a positive edge-triggered flop and ends at a negative edge-triggered flop?

    Because there is already half cycle hold margin in this path. So, looking at the timing, we do not require lockup latch here. However, due to DFT specific reasons, lockup latch is required here.

    Hi ,
    Suppose i have scenario where posedge flop followed by edge flop. Since scanclk frequence is less and we could still meet the half cycle timing, why still we need lockup latch. Could you please explain more in DFT reason why it required.
    Thanks in Advance

    Hi
    The answer lies in the basics of how DFT works. If you know the specifics, tester forces data only once during every scan cycle, and observes the data only once. Now, if there is a stuckat fault, for instance, the negative flop and positive flop would always have the same value. So, you can never have a pattern with 01 or 10 on these. Yes, you can work around for such cases, but, it would require intricate level monitoring of functional paths, and may change with every iteration of scan stitching.
    I hope it helps. :-)

    Yes, there may exist such tools. But you can scriptize the insertion of lockup latches, and the scripts are, in a way, small tools only. :-)

    Also you say "Who inserts a lock-up latch: These days, tools exist that automatically add lockup latches where a scan chain is crossing domains. However, for cases where a lockup latch is to be inserted in an intra-domain scan chain (i.e. for flops having uncommon path), it has to be inserted during physical implementation itself as physical information is not feasible during scan chain implementation (scan chain implementation is carried out at the synthesis stage itself)."
    I have not seen an option in the place and route tool to add a lockup latch.

    You need to add lockup latches specifically through netlist editing commands of PnR tools; for instance add\_inst, add\_net etc.

    lets say someone added lock up latch in the design, where it is not required , that means it is redundant, and we want to make it bypass, then how to do that check ,

    Hi
    I dont think bypassing a redundant lockup latch will be of any help in terms of area, power or timing. Of course, it will make sense if you want to remove it.
    First check, of course, should be to check valid lockup latch cases, for example if a lockup latch is inserted between neg\_flop -> pos\_flop paths, you can remove it.
    Another level of check can be latency of latch, launch flop and capture flop. If launch flop is built at a much larget latency than capture flop, ideally, you can remove that lockup latch.

    Since you have inserted negative latch, in fig7 how come hold is calculated in the positive edge of the clock(latch clock waveform) ?

    Hold to a negative latch is always checked on positive edge of the clock

    Is a lockup latch needed between a negative launch flop and positive capture flop when the clock domains are asynchronous? A lockup latch can tolerate skews only if they are less than half the clock period. Different tools do not insert for such cases but what if the skew is large enough?

    You should not design for such cases if skew is more than half clock period. And half clock period skew is a lot.
    Even if we assume hypothetically that skew is more than half clock cycle, then the only solution in my opinion is to multiple stages of lockup flops (pos -> neg -> pos ...) and each stage separated by a skew less than half clock cycle. \*But that kind of design is an overkill.

    If you modify figure 4 to a high phase latch (place it in the capturing domain), will that behave as a lock up latch? & Will it solve the problem?

    Yes, it will still behave as a lockup latch & solve the shift problem. But it will be more complex to handle in atspeed timing than a negative level latch tied to launch domain.

    Thanks a lot for your artical . But I have 2 questions :
    1\. how does this situation happen the skew between these two flops become large? In my opinion ,if they have timing checks ,during clock tree synthesis (especially scan clock) , tool will try to balance their skew.
    2\. will inserting look\_up latch affect logic equivalent check (LEC) or not ?

    Hi
    1\. Yes, cts tool tries to balance the skew. But there can be scan crossing between asynchronous functional clocks. This will not be balanced by the tool.
    2\. I have tried to answer here.

    Thanks for the explaination.
    Why can we add latches in scan paths only. Cant we add them to fix hold in functional paths ? any reason behind it.

    Hi
    Yes you can add latches in functional path as well to fix hold issues, but you have to be extremely cautious in doing so. The major reasons/precautions listed below:
    1\. Scan paths are not covered in LEC, hence, you can add any number of lockup latches in netlist without any need to modify the RTL. This is not true in case of functional path. Any such latch addition will need RTL update.
    2\. There might be a corner-case scenario that might get triggered with latch addition. Examples could be reset value not propagating through latch. Hence, even on adding a single latch, you need to verify all testcases for functionality.
    I hope I was able to answer your question.

    Thanks for the great article. Regarding polarity of lock up latch, you mentioned for flops triggering on positive edge of the clock, you need to have a negative level-sensitive lockup latch. In this case if we insert a positive level triggered latch at capture domain, that also works. Do we always insert opposite polarity latch?

    Not required since you should have sufficient positive hold margin to cover for variations in my opinion, since hold check is zero cycle in this case.

### 18. Routing – connecting the dots within chip

**Date:** 2013-06
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/06/routing-connecting-dots-within-chip.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/06/routing-connecting-dots-within-chip.html)

### Routing – connecting the dots within chip
Routing is an important step in the design of integrated
circuits. It involves generating metal wires to connect the pins of same signal
while obeying manufacturing design rules. Before routing is performed on the
design, cell placement has to be carried out wherein the cells used in the
design are placed. But the connections between the pins of the cells pertaining
to same signal need to be made. At the time of placement, there are only
logical connections between these pins. The physical connections are made by
routing. More generally speaking, **_routing is to locate a set of wires in_**
**_routing space so as to connect all the nets in the netlist taking into_**
**_consideration routing channels’ capacities, wire widths and crossings etc_**.
The objective of routing is to minimize total wire length and number of vias
and that each net meets its timing budget. The tools that perform routing are
termed as _routers_. You typically
provide them with a placed netlist along with list of timing critical nets.
These tools, in turn, provide you with the geometry of all the nets in the
design.
[![Design going through stages of synthesis, placement and routing](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTzVvFWyaOoxhYsuKSCb79Oun7wKO1Nj9NfHgNfn9zH2vT0N1ktQ3vmqArDuXCvQJWY1JG-9AkTlpFDQo7L55hzYUaFkpb3bU_39ByYyAPQ5mhkMRdRwtCKe2voMb8oB0gc70ZAEsXUl71/s640/from_synthesis_to_routing.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTzVvFWyaOoxhYsuKSCb79Oun7wKO1Nj9NfHgNfn9zH2vT0N1ktQ3vmqArDuXCvQJWY1JG-9AkTlpFDQo7L55hzYUaFkpb3bU_39ByYyAPQ5mhkMRdRwtCKe2voMb8oB0gc70ZAEsXUl71/s1013/from_synthesis_to_routing.png)
VLSI routing is generally considered to be a complex
combinatorial problem. Several algorithms have been developed for routing, each
having its own pros and cons. The complexity of the routing problem is very
high. To make it manageable, most routers usually take a two-step approach of
global routing (approximation of routing wires) followed by detailed routing
(actual routing of wires).
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3tnA-RJvyigQ8mGF7r8_vMF5Uil2iva-stt4k7g18f13EyKIsOzYOvFcLuJ2AuqMJoZJ2dv3n5wbzriCfuizBOsBGGsymOY_6bRoFjD-NsRk_bHrhqFHt05quwxwMuY-91JPhrqXU4dam/s640/placement_of_cells_global_routing_detailed_routing.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3tnA-RJvyigQ8mGF7r8_vMF5Uil2iva-stt4k7g18f13EyKIsOzYOvFcLuJ2AuqMJoZJ2dv3n5wbzriCfuizBOsBGGsymOY_6bRoFjD-NsRk_bHrhqFHt05quwxwMuY-91JPhrqXU4dam/s1067/placement_of_cells_global_routing_detailed_routing.png)
**Global routing**:
Using a global routing algorithm, the router divides the design into tiles,
each tile having a limited number of tracks and generates “loose” route for
each connection by finding tile-to-tile paths (As shown in figure (ii)). The
routes are not finalized, but the approximate length is known by the distance
among the tiles. For example, a tile may have 12 tracks. So, global router will
assign 12 tracks to each tile. But, the final assignment of the track is not
done during global routing.
**Detailed routing**:
Using detailed routing, the router determines the exact route for each net by
searching within tile-to-tile path. It involves providing actual physical path
to a net from one connected pin to another (as shown in figure (iii)). Hence,
detailed routed wire represents actual resistance, capacitance and length of
the net.
**What router has to**
**take care**: While routing, a router has to pertain to specific
constraints like timing budget for each critical net, also called performance
constraints. There are other performance constraints too – like the router has
to route in such a way as not to cause any crosstalk issues. There should not
be any antenna issues. Also, there are a set of design rules like resistance,
capacitance, wire/via width/spacing that need to be followed. For instance,
technology may be limited by the minimum feature size it can have. Like, in 65
nm technology, the foundry cannot have wire widths less than 65 nm. So, the
wires in the design have to be constrained to have wire length greater than 65
nm. Similarly, there are foundry specific constraints for other parameters.
Each of these is termed as a Design Rule. Any violation pertaining to these in
the design is termed as DRC (Design Rule Check) violation.
**Grid based and**
**gridless routing**: In grid based routing, a routing grid is superimposed
on routing region. Routing takes place along the grid lines. The space between
adjacent grid lines is called wire pitch and is equal to sum of minimum width
of wires and spacing of wires. On the other hand, any model that does not
follow grid based routing is termed as gridless routing model. This model is suitable
for wire sizing and perturbation and is more complex and slower than grid based
routing. In other words, grid based routing is much easier and simpler in
implementation.
[![Wire pitch is the sum of wire distance and wire width. Or we can say it is the distance between two grid lines](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicjLKZ6lBpHqqolV0bXBWLH5vnbCF4RtpaNE2oGZF41qO51tI7gOvsqsUtCzsKIXqSCie4ElQ__CvlCxGn1Sdf3pbF-9MKeYMsnttraiNub9K-zx1EQjPU6C0s5pu3boq4wxh52YlZbVoQ/s640/grid+based+routing+parameters.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicjLKZ6lBpHqqolV0bXBWLH5vnbCF4RtpaNE2oGZF41qO51tI7gOvsqsUtCzsKIXqSCie4ElQ__CvlCxGn1Sdf3pbF-9MKeYMsnttraiNub9K-zx1EQjPU6C0s5pu3boq4wxh52YlZbVoQ/s1077/grid+based+routing+parameters.png)
We have discussed here routing in VLSI designs. Although many
advanced tools are available for achieving the purpose, most of these
compromise with the quality of results to save run-time. Almost all tools have
the option of routing with more emphasis on meeting timing or congestion. With
most of the tools, in present day multi-million gate designs, perfect DRC-free routing
(without opens and shorts) is generally not obtained in first pass. You have to
route incrementally a few times to achieve the same.

### 19. Power aware RTL design

**Date:** 2013-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/05/power-aware-rtl-design.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/05/power-aware-rtl-design.html)

### Power aware RTL design
|     |     |     |     |
|  |
|  |  |  |  |
With the progress in technology,
the designs are moving into deeper sub-micron technology nodes. There is an
ever-increasing concern about power dissipation within the SoC. But this should
not come at the cost of performance. So, along with less power dissipation,
there is need for maximum power efficiency, that is maximum proportion of
available power should be used for useful purposes rather than just to keep the
device awake. Now the question arises: Whether to start planning from power
perspective at the RTL Design level or wait for the problems to be fixed in the
backend flow of the design cycle. The answer is former. Efforts are made to
achieve maximum power efficiency along all the stages of the design. But the
backend flow can only implement the changes at physical level. It cannot fix
the micro-architecture which has a significant impact on the dynamic power
dissipation within the SoC.

| **Figure showing Impact of design change on performace** |
Power aware design is achieved at
several levels of abstraction. System design starts from system requirements
and specification and goes through design at architecture design, RTL design,
gate level design and finally, layout design. At all these stages, techniques
are adopted to meet the design power and performance requirements. It has been
found that any effort that is made to improve the power efficiency along all
the design stages has maximum impact, if it is done at the RTL level. But, the
impact is measured most immediately if it is done at the layout level. So, it
is very difficult to measure the impact of any architectural change at RTL
level. Improvements are needed for power estimation methods at the RTL level.
But, it does not mean that backend techniques should not be adopted.
Power aware design is often
misunderstood as low power design. But, these are not the same. By low power
design, we mean minimizing the power consumption with or without any
performance constraint. But by power aware design, is meant the minimizing the
power dissipation without any impact on power. Power aware design refers to
maximizing some other performance constraint without any significant impact on
power efficiency. Achieving maximum performance being constrained to a
particular power budget is the aim of power aware design.
As said earlier, there is an ever
increasing demand for low power devices. As these devices run on batteries
having limited supply, and the requirement for them is to operate the maximum
they can on a single battery. There are long phases of device idle time. In
between, the device is active for very small periods of time. And during the
active time, high performance is the requirement. One such example is digital
energy meters where there is requirement to keep record of the total kWh used.
The power may be available in patches, or may be continuously available. There
may be long periods when there is no power. Since the power is available, we
can afford to have chargeable batteries, but the watts consumed by the
controller itself should be very less as compared to the total power consumed
so as to minimize the overhead. During the idle periods, device may go to sleep
mode so as to save power. As long as power is available, it should wake up
immediately. In other words, average power is less but variance in power
consumption is very high.Hence, it
requires a provision in RTL to sense incoming signal levels and to change the
gears accordingly. There are many techniques adopted for power aware RTL designsuch as performance
throttling, judicious
module selection, incorporation
of power information in RTL, voltage
and power islands and power
aware design of memories.

### 20. 2 bit Binary multiplier

**Date:** 2013-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/05/binary-multiplier.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/05/binary-multiplier.html)

### 2 bit Binary multiplier
**Binary multiplication process**: A Binary Multiplier is a digital
circuit used in digital electronics to multiply two binary numbers and provide
the result as output. The method used to multiply two binary numbers is similar
to the method taught to school children for multiplying decimal numbers which
is based on calculating partial product, shifting them and adding them together.
Similar approach is used to multiply two binary numbers. Long multiplicand is
multiplied by 0 or 1 which is much easier than decimal multiplication as
product by 0 or 1 is 0 or same number respectively. Figure 1 below shows the block diagram of a 2-bit binary multiplier. The two numbers A1A0 and B1B0 are multiplied together to produce a 4-bit output P3P2P1P0. (The maximum product term can be 3 \* 3 = 9, which is 1001, a 4-bit number).

| **Figure 1: 2-bit Binary Multiplier Block Diagram** |
Let us take an example of multiplying two binary numbers as follows. The process is similar to multiplying two decimal numbers, with a difference that the resulting numbers are all binary.
**110 = 6**
**X011 = 3**
\-\-\---------------------------
**1 1 0;**
**110 X 1**
**1**
**1 0 x; 110 X 1**
**0**
**0 0 x x; 110 X 0**
\-\-\----------------------------
**1 0 0 1 0 =18**
Now, we have seen that
multiplying a number with binary ‘0’produces all zeroes, and with ‘1’ reproduces
the number. So, multiplying two binary numbers is a straightforward job. It can
be implemented without much difficulty using shifters, AND gates and adders.
**2-bit binary multiplier circuit implementation**: Let us implement a
two bit binary multiplier. Let the two binary numbers be A1A0
and B1B0. The multiplication table will, then, look as:
**A1A0**
**XB1B0**
**\-\-\-----------------------------------------------------------------**
**B0A1B0A0**
**B1A1B1A0x**
**\-\-\-----------------------------------------------------------------**
**P3       P2       P1  P0**
Thus, we get the partial products as:
**P0 = A0\*B0**
**P1 = A0\*B1 xor A1 \* B0; carry generated here goes**
**to next stage**
**P2 = A1\*B1xor (A0\*B1) \* (A1\*B0)**
**P3 = A1\*B1and(A0\*B1) \* (A1\*B0)**

| **Two-bit binary multiplier circuit diagram** |
Thus, we can see that a 2-bit binary multiplier can be implemented using two half-adders only.
**Characteristics**
**of a binary multiplication**:
As mentioned above, a binary multiplier is used to multiply binary numbers. In
general, the characteristics of binary multiplication are as follows:
- To multiply two binary
numbers, AND gates, shifters and adders are required.
- Product of N\*M bit binary
numbers in of (N+M) bits.
- N\*M AND gates are required to generate
partial products of two M\*N bit binary numbers.
- Number of adders required = N+M-2
- Speed limiting factor here
is to sum up partial products.

### 21. Spare Cells

**Date:** 2013-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/05/spare-cells.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/05/spare-cells.html)

### Spare Cells
We
have discussed in our post titled ' [Engineering Change Order](http://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.in/2013/05/engineering-change-order-eco.html)' about the important to have a uniform
distribution of spare cells in the design. Nowadays, there is a trend among the
VLSI corporations to implement metal-only functional and timing ECOs due to
their low-cost. Let us discuss about the spare cells in a bit more detail here.
|     |
| [![Spare cells are distributed randomly in the design, with their inputs and outputs tied to ground](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8oVYvdWkRlC8rMhNCBwCkoMiSz_wUgh0PAmPufeMpCQV_N9zQ6sVRhVaaOLytludFO457gIdue8VxnAeZczqzykfO7nuVxff3ct8arPcOMole1RVOdMgFktizpaqm-qUucF0ZiSzNUsbe/s640/fig1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8oVYvdWkRlC8rMhNCBwCkoMiSz_wUgh0PAmPufeMpCQV_N9zQ6sVRhVaaOLytludFO457gIdue8VxnAeZczqzykfO7nuVxff3ct8arPcOMole1RVOdMgFktizpaqm-qUucF0ZiSzNUsbe/s1600/fig1.png) |
| Figure showing spare cells in the design |
Spare cells are put
onto the chip during implementation keeping into view the possibility of
modifications that are planned to be carried out into the design without
disturbing the layers of base. This is because carrying out design changes with
minimal layer changes saves a lot of cost from fabrication point of view as
each layer mask has a significant cost of its own. Let us start by defining
what a spare cell is. A spare cell can be thought of as a redundant cell that
is not used currently in the design. It may be in use later on, but currently,
it is sitting without doing any job. A spare cell does not contribute to the
functionality of the device. We can compare a spare cell with a spare wheel
being carried in a motor car to be used in case one of the wheels gets
punctured. In that case, the spare wheel will be replacing the main wheel.
Similarly, a spare cell can be used to replace an existing cell if the
situation demands (eg. to meet the timing). However, unlike spare wheels, spare
cells may be added to the design even if they do not replace any existing cell
according as the need arises.
**Kinds of spare cells**: There are
many variants of spare cells in the design. Designs are full of spare
inverters, buffers, nand, nor and specially designed configurable spare cells.
However, based on the origin of spare cells, these can be divided into two
broad categories:
- **Those used deliberately as spare cells in the design**: As
discussed earlier, most of the designs today have spare cells sprinkled
uniformly. These cells have inputs and outputs tied to either ‘0’ or ‘1’
so that they contribute minimum to static and dynamic power.
- **Those converted into spare cells due to design changes:** There
may be a case that a cell that is being identified as a spare now was a
main cell in the past. Due to some design changes, the cell might have
been replaced by another cell. Also, some cells have floating outputs.
These can be used as spare cells. We can also use the used buffers as
spare cells if removing the buffer does not introduce any setup/hold
violation in the design.
**Advantages of using spare cells in the**
**design**: Introduction of spare cells into the design offers several
advantages such as:
- **Reusability**: A design change can be carried out using metal
layers only. So, the base layers can be re-used for fabrication of new
chips.
- **Cost reduction**: Significant amount of money is saved both in
terms of engineering and manufacture costs.
- **Design flexibility**: As there are spare cells, small changes
can be taken into the design without much difficulty. Hence, the presence
of spare cells provides flexibility to the design.
- **Cycle time reduction**: Nowadays, there is a trend to tape out
base layers to the foundry for fabrication as masks are not prepared in
parallel. In the meantime, the timing violations/design changes are being
carried out in metal layers. Hence, there is cycle time reduction of one
to two weeks.
**Disadvantages of using spare cells**:
In addition to many advantages, usage of spare cells offers some disadvantages
too. These are:
- **Contribution to static power**: Each spare cell has its static
power dissipation. Hence, greater amount of spare cells contribute more to
power. But, in general, this amount of power is insignificant in
comparison to total power. Spare cells should be added keeping into
consideration their contribution to power.
- **Area**: Spare cells occupy area on the chip. So, more spare
cells mean more density of cells.
Thus,
we have discussed about the spare cells here. Spare cells are used almost in
every design in each device manufactured today. It is important to make an
intelligent selection of spare cells to be sprinkled in the design. Many
technical papers have been published stating its importance and on the
structure of the spare cells that can be generalized to be used as any of the
logic gate. In general, a collection of nand/nor/inverters/buffers is sprinkled
more or less uniformly. The modules where more number of ECOs are expected,
(like a new architecture being used for the first time) should be sprinkled
with more spare cells. On the contrary, those having stable architectures are
usually sprinkled with less number of spare cells as the probability of an ECO
is very less in the vicinity of these modules/macros.
I hope you’ve found this post useful. Let me know what you think in the comments. I’d love to hear from you all.

Hi ,I have one question , that is , as far as I know , we ususlly tie the input pins of spare cells , just left the outputs floating , so both inputs and outputs tied can save more power ?

Hi
There can be two cases:
1\. Output has invert relationship with input. Examples include nand, nor etc. In that case, what you recommend is possible and more appropriate solution
2\. Output has positive unate relationship with the input, examples buffer, and, or, mus etc. In that case, the gate will not be able to settle on a value and will always lie somewhere near vdd/2. And will constantly consume shot circuit power.
Thus, we cannot blindly tie outputs to inputs and need a better algorithm for the same.

### 22. ­Our world – Digital or analog

### ­Our world – Digital or analog
[![Digtal device interfacing with so-called analog world](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8qPE9a7Yw_Dp5ETfa9e4_tMJpx2-ry-mFcZzdSw5TdJoGrcqjfQKzT3fkW4cCrYxuQsLQHWUgT2TSAGS-CETOylyvyabQKrdpNZCku2Zehhq3t6NGimnkcTFmw5JRUslHgVgBFIDb_1Ax/s320/fig1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8qPE9a7Yw_Dp5ETfa9e4_tMJpx2-ry-mFcZzdSw5TdJoGrcqjfQKzT3fkW4cCrYxuQsLQHWUgT2TSAGS-CETOylyvyabQKrdpNZCku2Zehhq3t6NGimnkcTFmw5JRUslHgVgBFIDb_1Ax/s1600/fig1.png) There are two kinds of electronic systems that we
encounter in our daily life – digital and analog. Digital systems are the ones
in which the variables to be dealt with can presume only some specified values
whereas in analog systems, these variables can assume any of the infinite
values. The superiority of digital devices over analog devices has ever been a
topic of discussion. This is the reason why digital devices have taken over
analog in almost all the areas that we encounter today. Digital computers,
digital watches, digital thermometers etc. have replaced analog computers,
analog watches and analog thermometers, and so on. Digital devices have
replaced the analog ones due to their superior performance, better ability to
handle noise and reliability in spite of being more costly than analog ones. Although
most of the devices used today are digital, but in general, the world around us
seems to be analog. All the physical quantities around us; i.e. Light, heat,
current are analog. The so called digital devices have to interface with this
analog real world only. For instance, a digital camera interfaces with analog
signal (light) and converts it into information in the form of pixels that
collectively form a digital image. Similarly, a music system converts the digital
information stored in a music CD into pleasant music which is nothing but
analog sound waves. All the digital devices that we know have this
characteristic in common. Simply speaking, there are devices known as Analog to
Digital converters (ADC) and Digital to Analog converters (DAC) that acts as an
interface between the real analog world and the digital devices and converts
the data sensed by analog sensor into the digital information understood by the
digital system and vice-versa. They all interface with the so called analog
world. But is the analog world really analog? Is it true that analog variables
can take any number of values? Or is there some limit of granularity for them
too. Is this world inherently digital or analog in nature? Is digital more
fundamental than analog?
As we all know, there are many fundamental
quantities in this universe viz. Mass, length, time, charge, light etc. We have
been encountering these ever since the world has begun. Now the question arises
– whether all these quantities are inherently analog or digital? Finding the
answer to this question will automatically bring us to the answer of our main
question; i.e. whether the basics of this world lie in analog or digital. It is
often said that “Heart of digital devices is analog.” (See figure below). This
is because, as visible on a macroscopic scale, the current and voltage
waveforms produced by a digital circuit/system are not digital in fact. This
can be observed from the fact that the transition from one logic state to
another cannot be abrupt.Also, there
are small spikes in the voltage levels even if the system is stable in one
state. But, seen at microscopic level in terms of transfer of current by
transfer of electrons, since, there can only be

transfer of an integral number of electrons,
current can only take one of numerous values, and not just any value. Let us
take an illustration. The charge on an electron is 1.6E19 (or
0.00000000000000000016) represented as ‘e’. It is the smallest charge ever
discovered. It is well known that charge can exist only in the multiples of
‘e’. Thus, electric charge is a digital quantity with the smallest unit ‘e’. When
we say that the value of charge at a point is +1C, we actually mean that the
charge is caused by transfer of 6250000000000000000 electrons. Since, the
smallest unit of charge is 0.00000000000000000016 C, hence, there cannot exist
any charge of value 1.00000000000000000015 C, since that will make the number
of electrons to be a fraction. Since, the magnitude of 1C is very large as
compared to charge on 1e, it appears to us as continuous and not discrete. For
us, there is no difference between 1. 00000000000000000015 and 1 as the devices
we use don’t measure with that much precision. Hence, we infer these quantities
as analog. Similar is the case with other physical quantities.
Many laws have been formed by our great scientists postulating
about the quantization of some basic physical quantities. Viz. Planck’s quantum
theory states that angular momentum of an electron in the orbit of an atom is
quantized. Simply stated, it states that the angular momentum can take only
specified values given as multiples of h/2Π. Thus, the smallest angular
momentum an electron can have is h/2Π and the angular momentum can increment
only in steps of h/2Π. If we take h/2Π as one unit, then we can say that
angular momentum of an electron is a digital quantity. Similarly speaking,
Light is also known to consist of photons. According to Planck’s quantum
theory, the light intensity is also an integral multiple of the intensity of a
single photon. Thus, light is also inherently a digital quantity. Also, as
stated above, the charge is also quantized.
But there are some physical quantities of which
quantization is yet to be established. Mass is one of those quantities. But, it
is believed that the quantization of mass will be established soon.
Thus, we have seen that most of the physical
quantities known are known to be digital at microscopic level. Since, we
encounter these at macroscopic level having billions and billions of basic
units, the increments in these seem to be continuous to us as the smallest
incremental unit is negligible in comparison to actual measure of the quantity
and we perceive them as analog in nature.
Thus, we can come to the conclusion that most of
the quantities in this world are digital by their blood. Once the quantization
of mass will be established, we can conclude with surety that digital lies in
the soul of this world. This digital is similar to our definition of digital
systems; just the difference is that it occurs at a very minute scale which we
cannot perceive at our own.

### 23. Engineering Change Order (ECO)

**Date:** 2013-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/05/engineering-change-order-eco.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/05/engineering-change-order-eco.html)

### Engineering Change Order (ECO)
A semiconductor chip
undergoes synthesis, placement, clock tree synthesis and routing processes
before going for fabrication. All these processes require some time, hence, it
requires time (9 months to 1 year for a normal sized chip) for a new chip to be
sent for fabrication. As a result of cut-throat competition, all the
semiconductor companies stress on Cycle-time reduction to be ahead of others in
the race. New ways are being found out to achieve the same. New techniques are
being developed and more advanced tools are being used. Sometimes, the new chip
to be produced may be an incremental change over an existing product. In such a
case, there may not be the need to go over the same cycle of complete
synthesis, placement and routing. However, everything may be carried out in
incremental manner so as to reduce engineering costs, time and manufacture
costs.
It is a known fact that
the fabrication process of a VLSI chip involves manufacture of a number of
masks, each mask corresponding to one layer. There are two kinds of layers –
base and metal. **Base layers contain the**
**information regarding the geometry and kind of transistors, resistors,**
**capacitors and other devices. Metal layers contain information regarding metal**
**interconnects used for connection of devices.** For a sub-micron technology,
the **mask costs may be greater than a**
**million dollars**. Hence, to minimize the cost, the tendency is to reuse as
many masks as possible. So, it is tried to implement the ECO with minimal
number of layers change. Also, due to cycle time crunch, it is a tradition to
send the base layers for the manufacture of masks while the metals are still
modified to eliminate any kind of DRC’s. This saves around two weeks in cycle
time. The base layer masks are developed while metal layers are still being
modified.
**What conditions cause an Engineering Change Order**: As
mentioned above, ECO are needed when the process steps are needed to be
executed in an incremental manner. This may be due to-
- Some
functionality enhancement of the existing device. This functionality
enhancement change may be too small to undergo all the process steps again
- There
may be some design bug that needs to be fixed and was caught very late in
the design cycle. It is very costly to re-run all the process cycle steps
for each bug in terms of time and cost. Hence, these changes need to be
taken incrementally.
Normally, there is a case
that design enhancements/functional bug fixes are being implemented after the
design has already been sent for fabrication. For instance, the functional bug
may be caught in silicon itself. To fix
the bug, it is not practical to restart the cycle.
The ECO process starts
with the changes in the definition to be implemented into the RTL. The
resulting netlist synthesized from the modified netlist is, then, compared with
the golden netlist being implemented. The logic causing the difference is then
implemented into the main netlist. The netlist, then, undergoes placement of
the incremental logic, clock tree modifications and routing optimizations based
upon the requirements.
**Kinds**
**of ECO**: The engineering change orders can be classified into two
categories:
- **All layers ECO**: In this, the design change is
implemented using all layers. This kind of ECO provides advantage in terms
of cycle time and engineering costs. It is implemented whenever the change
is not possible to be carried out without all layer change e.g. there is
an updation in a hard macro cell or the change may require updation of
100’s of cells. It is almost impossible to contain such a large change to
a few layers only.
- **Metal-only ECO**: As discussed above, due to incurring
costs, sometimes, it may not be practical to use all the layers (base +
metal) to do the ECO. In that case, to minimize the cost, it is required
to be completed with changes only in minimal number of metal layers. These
days, it is expected that every design will be re-opened for the ECOs. So,
an adequate number of spare cells are sprinkled during the implementation
all over the design to be used later on. These cells are spread uniformly
over the design. The inputs of these cells are tied. Whenever the need for
an ECO arises, the cells to be implemented can be mapped into the existing
spare cells. Hence, there is no need to change the base layers in such a
case. Only the connections need to be updated which can be done by
changing the metal layers only. Hence, the base layer cost is saved.
**Steps**
**to carry out an ECO**: The ECOs are best implemented manually. There
exist some automated ways to carry out the functional ECOs, but the most
efficient and effective method is to implement manually. Generally, following
steps are employed to carry out Engineering Change Orders:
1. The RTL with ECO
    implemented is synthesized and compared with the golden netlist.
2. The delta is
    implemented into the golden netlist. The modified netlist is then again
    compared with the synthesized netlist to ensure the logic has been
    implemented correctly.
3. The logic is the
    placed incrementally. However, if it is metal-only ECO, spare cells in
    the proximity of the changed logic are found out.
4. The connections are,
    then, modified in metal layers.

### 24. MBIST (Memory Built-In Self Test)

**Date:** 2013-05
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/05/mbist.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/05/mbist.html)

### MBIST (Memory Built-In Self Test)
The ever increasing size and number of
memories in the Systems on Chip has presented the designers and test engineers
with a challenge for huge number of functional or ATPG patterns for
verification of memory functionality. So, to test the memory functionality
either functionally or through ATPG requires huge test time, and hence, huge
test cost. It is almost impossible in such scenario to verify memory
functionality fully. Thus, the designers are left with only one way; i.e. to
verify memory functionality through BIST (Built-In Self Test) functionality.
BIST is an inbuilt testing circuitry
within a software/hardware module. We just need to trigger the circuitry from
outside. This circuitry, then, runs the inbuilt patterns/algorithms and returns
if the module is working properly. This, being inbuilt does not need to be
supplied with patterns from outside. Also, since, this is within a module,
hence, we can take the modular approach for testing which reduces run time
significantly.
[![Figure to show mbist interface. MBIST testing involves a mbist controller+pattern generator that controls the testing](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi9aW8pbDZEHWsUzZ7WU82DdqT9ZqG9527MI9Vaalm07K2QjJsWHgHH_BEdAnvxvBv8dEXAJRxUB2VFohMeBW4KupOF8L53gjTbbsWj8zpXxYqwH3OuMmKyBQ6v_w5CHzlfI-Tcb0LmheI4/s320/mbist_1.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi9aW8pbDZEHWsUzZ7WU82DdqT9ZqG9527MI9Vaalm07K2QjJsWHgHH_BEdAnvxvBv8dEXAJRxUB2VFohMeBW4KupOF8L53gjTbbsWj8zpXxYqwH3OuMmKyBQ6v_w5CHzlfI-Tcb0LmheI4/s1600/mbist_1.png) The built-in self test employed for
memories is known as MBIST (Memory Built-In Self Test). Like other BIST logic,
MBIST logic is inbuilt within memory only. The MBIST logic may be capable of
running several algorithms to verify memory functionality and test for memory
faults specifically designed and optimized for these.
There is usually a wrapper around
memory, known as ‘ _memory collar’_ that
is used to select between functional inputs and test inputs based upon MBIST/functional
mode selection bit. It interfaces the memory with on-chip logic and MBIST
controller. The MBIST controller indicates the start of MBIST with a select
input. The memory, then, starts the BIST algorithms and provides the test
output to the controller. The controller compares this output with the
reference output and indicates if the MBIST has passed or failed. There can be
one controller for several memories. Also, memories can share the collar
depending upon the test time requirement and type of memories.
**Advantages of MBIST**: There are several advantages of MBIST
insertion over functional/atspeed testing such as:
- It allows for
robust testing of memories
- Reduced test time
- All the memories
of the design can be tested in parallel
- Lesser test cost
**Disadvantages of MBIST**: Inspite of many advantage of MBIST, there is
only one remarkable limitation. Insertion of MBIST causes increase in area.
However, this increase in area is very small in comparison to the benefits it
provides.

### 25. Latchup and its prevention in CMOS devices

**Date:** 2013-03
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/03/latchup-condition-in-cmos-devices.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/03/latchup-condition-in-cmos-devices.html)

### Latchup and its prevention in CMOS devices
**What is Latchup**: Latchup refers to short circuit formed between power and ground rails in
an IC leading to high current and damage to the IC. Speaking about CMOS
transistors, latch up is the phenomenon of low impedance path between
power rail and ground rail due to interaction between parasitic pnp and npn
transistors. The structure formed by these resembles a Silicon Controlled rectifier (SCR, usually known as a thyristor, a PNPN device used in power
electronics). These form a +ve feedback loop, short circuit the power rail and
ground rail, which eventually causes excessive current, and can even permanently damage

| [![Latchup refers to short circuit formed between power rails in an IC leading to high current and damage to the IC. Speaking about CMOS transistors, latch up is the phenomenon of low impedance path in CMOS between power rail and ground rail due to interaction between parasitic pnp and npn transistors. The structure formed by these resembles a Silicon Controlled transistor (SCR, usually known as a thyristor, a PNPN device used in power electronics). These form a +ve feedback loop, short circuit the power rail and ground rail, which eventually causes excessive current and even permanently damage the device.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihIe-YFEUZNJkDTmfHUiWu-Z1-YFfXWos0ocxv7xpB1uYHSFx9r0MpTYLBU5nHtpmnRbozLFSMCjfX01adRFgtOLyK7gfBuGBfBknWfGCsFjnUhL1UqWaV4ozS4yqv18vbaqNS6Dy11Fgs/s400/latchup.JPG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihIe-YFEUZNJkDTmfHUiWu-Z1-YFfXWos0ocxv7xpB1uYHSFx9r0MpTYLBU5nHtpmnRbozLFSMCjfX01adRFgtOLyK7gfBuGBfBknWfGCsFjnUhL1UqWaV4ozS4yqv18vbaqNS6Dy11Fgs/s1600/latchup.JPG) |
| **Figure 1: Latchup formation in CMOS** |
**Latchup formation**: Shown alongside is a CMOS transistor consisting of an NMOS
and a PMOS device. Q1 and Q2 are parasitic transistor elements residing inside
it. Q1 is double emitter pnp transistor whose base is formed by n well
substrate of PMOS, two emitters are formed by source and drain terminal of PMOS
and collector is formed by substrate(p type) of NMOS. The reverse is true for
Q2. The two parasitic transistors form a positive feedback loop and is
equivalent to an SCR (as stated earlier).
**Analysis of latchup formation**: Unless SCR is triggered by an external disturbance, the
collector current of both transistors consists of reverse leakage current. But if
collector current of one of BJT is temporarily increased by disturbance,
resulting positive feedback loop causes current perturbation to be multiplied
by β1β2 as explained below. The disturbance may be a spike of input voltage on
an input or output pin, leading to junction breakdown, or ionizing radiations.
Because collector current of one transistor Q1 is fed as
input base current to another transistor Q2, collector currentof Q2, Ic2 =β2 \* Ib2 and this collector current Ic2 is fed as input base current
Ib1to another transistorQ1. In this way both transistors feedback
each other and the collector current of each goes on multiplying.
Net gain of SCR device = β1 \*β2
Total current in one loop = current perturbation \* Gain
If **β1 \*β2 >=1**, both
transistors will conduct a high saturation current even after the triggering
perturbation is no longer available. This current will eventually becomes so
large that it may damage the device.
**Latch-up prevention techniques**: Simply put, latchup prevention/protection includes putting a high resistance in the path so as to limit the current
through supply and make β1 \*β2 < 1. This can be done with the help of following techniques:
- Surrounding PMOS and NMOS transistors with an
insulating oxide layer (trench). This breaks parasitic SCR structure.
- Latchup Protection Technology circuitry which
shuts off the device when latchup is detected.

### 26. Metastability

**Date:** 2013-02
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/02/metastability.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2013/02/metastability.html)

### Metastability
**What is metastability**: Metastability is a
phenomenon of unstable equilibrium in digital electronics in which the
sequential element is not able to resolve the state of the input signal; hence,
the output goes into unresolved state for an unbounded interval of time. Almost
always, this happens when data transitions very close to active edge of the
clock, hence, violating setup and hold requirements. Since, data makes
transition close to active edge of clock, the flop is not able to capture the
data completely. The flop starts to capture the data and output also starts to
transition. But, before output has changed its state, the input is cut-off from
the output as clock edge has arrived. The output is, then, left hanging between
state ‘0’ and state ‘1’. Theoretically, the output may remain in this state for
an indefinite period of time. But, given the time to settle down, the output
will eventually settle to either its previous state or the new state. Thus, the
effect of signal present at input of flop may not travel to the output of the
flop partly or completely. In other words, we can say that when a flip-flop
enters metastable state, one cannot predict its output voltage level after it
exits the metastability state nor when the output will settle to some stable
voltage level. The metastability failure is said to have occurred if the output
has not resolved itself by the time it must be available for use. Also, since,
the output remains in-between ‘0’ and ‘1’, which means both P-MOS and N-MOS are
not switched off. Hence, VDD is shorted to GND terminal making it cause a high
current to flow through as long as the output is hanging in-between.
**Metastability example**: Consider a CMOS inverter
circuit as shown below. The current vs voltage (we can also say power vs
voltage as VDD is constant) characteristics for this circuit are also shown. It
can be observed that output current is 0 for both input voltage levels; i.e.
‘0’ and ‘1’. As the voltage level is increased from ‘logic 0’, the current
increases. It attains its maximum value at ‘Vin’ somewhere near VDD/2. It again
starts decreasing as ‘Vin’ is increased further and again becomes 0 when ‘Vin’
is at ‘logic 1’. Thus, there is a local maxima for power consumption for CMOS
inverter. At this point, the device is in unstable equilibrium. As for CMOS
inverter, for other CMOS devices too, there lies ‘a local maxima’ at some value
of input voltage. We all know that for a flip-flop, the output stage is a
combinational gate (mostly an inverter). So, we can say that the output of the
flip-flop is prone to metastability provided right input level.

| **Figure 1: Power characteristics of CMOS inverter** |
As we now know that a
CMOS combinational gate has a point on its ‘voltage characteristic’ curve that
is quasi-stable, let us look at a CMOS latch from the same perspective. The
CMOS latch has a transmission gate followed by two inverters connected in
feedback loop. The voltage characteristic curves for the two inverters are
shown. The metastable point, here, lies where the two curves intersect as this
point is the resulting peak point of the ‘Superposition curve’ resulting from
the two individual curves. A latch goes into metastable state very frequently,
especially if the input is changing fast. But, this metastability is resolved
quickly as the output tends to go to one of its stable states. As a flop is
generally made by connecting two latches in master-slave configuration, the
flops are also prone to be metastable. The difference here is just that the
probability of a flip-flop being metastable is a lot less than latches as
‘flops are edge sensitive’ as compared to latches which are level sensitive.

| **Figure 2: Transfer curves of two inverters in a D-latch** |
We have just came to know
that different elements are prone to metastability to different extents. There
is a measure to determine the extent to which an element is prone to
metastability failure. This is given by an interval known as ‘Mean Time Between
Failures’ (MTBF) and is a measure of how prone an element is to failure. It
gives the average time interval between two successive failures. The failure
rate is given as the reciprocal of MTBF.

### 27. Carry Look Ahead Adder

### Carry Look Ahead Adder
**Carry look ahead adder definition**: Carry Look Ahead Adder (CLA Adder) (also known as Carry Look
Ahead Generator) is one of the digital circuits used to implement addition of
binary numbers. Itisanimprovementover'Ripplecarryadder'circuit.InRippleCarryadders,carrypropagationtimeisthemajorspeedlimitingfactor as it works on the
basic mechanism to generate carries as we generally do while adding two numbers
using pen and paper. A ripple carry adder may be supposed to be built of a
series of 1-bit adders (generally known as a full adder in digital
electronics). Thus, the speed of ripple carry adder is a direct function of
number of bits. On the other hand,Carry Look Ahead
adder solvesthisproblembycalculatingcarry signals
in advancebaseduponinputbits and does not wait for the input signal to propagate through
different adder stages. Hence, it implements the adder with reduced delay at
the cost of more area (as large combinational logic is required to calculate
the look ahead carry as compared to propagated carry).
[![Full adder block diagram](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8AYlxjVyEth9HIt7Erbw_m2GCvyVXrz6m3MYwDRScVBtW3oDGa3J4L46YHew-fTRRutwNY1UjSnmGF5f8P9qGTlvVTFGFnd4kClHfC4vj4mrnOVDeMoMbrdoER4e08PLruzUlgUUkHo7a/s320/full+added.JPG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8AYlxjVyEth9HIt7Erbw_m2GCvyVXrz6m3MYwDRScVBtW3oDGa3J4L46YHew-fTRRutwNY1UjSnmGF5f8P9qGTlvVTFGFnd4kClHfC4vj4mrnOVDeMoMbrdoER4e08PLruzUlgUUkHo7a/s1600/full+added.JPG) Shown below is the truth table for a full adder (carry look ahead adder). Ai
and Bi are two input bits and Ci is the carry input
from the previous stage. Si (Sum) and Ci+1 (Carry out for the
next stage) are the outputs for the next stage of the adder. As is evident, carrysignal is generatedifatleasttwoinputsoffulladderare1i.e.
- WhenbothbitsAiandBiis1(regardlessofCin) **OR**
- Whenoneof the twoinputs (AiorBi)is1andcarry-in (carryofpreviousstage)is1
|     |     |     |     |     |
| **A** **i** | **B** **i** | **Ci** | **S** **i** | **Ci+1** |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
The outputs of this full adder, when expressed in the form
of a boolean expression can be written as a function of inputs as follows:
**S** **i** **=** **A** **i** **xor** **B** **i** **xor** **C** **i**
**C** **i+1** **=** **C** **i(A** **i** **xor** **B** **i)** **+** **A** **iB** **i**
Where Si is the sum bit calculated for nth
adder stage and Ci+1 is the carry out from nth
stage and will act as input for n+1th stage. For an N
stage ripple carry adder, there is overhead of calculating the carry out of kth
stage before carry out of k+1th stage can be calculated. If we go deeper
into analysis, it comes out that ck+1 is a function of c0
and is discussed below. Let the intermediate outputs from a full adder stage be
represented as Pi and Gi given as below:
**Pi** **=** **Ai** **xor** **Bi**
**Gi** **=** **Ai.Bi**
**Si** **=** **Pi** **xor** **Ci**
**Ci+1** **=** **Ci.Pi** **+** **Gi**
- Giisknownascarrygeneratesignalsincecarry(Ci+1)isgeneratedwheneverGi=1regardlessofCi
- Piisknownascarrypropagatesignalsincewhenever Pi=1,Ci+1=Ci(whenPi=1,Gi=0)
Thus, recursively replacing the values for Ci for each Ck,
we can write the booleanexpressionofcarryoutputsofvariousstages in terms of C0 and Pk's asfollows:
> **C1=C0P0+G0** **C2=C1P1+G1=(C0P0+G0)P1+G1=C0P0P1+P1G0+G1** **C3=C2P2+G2=(C0P0P1+P1G0+G1)P2+G2=C0P0P1P2+P2P1G0+P2G1+G2** **C4=C3P3+G3=(C0P0P1P2+P2P1G0+P2G1+G2)P3+G3=C0P0P1P2P3+P3P2P1G0+P3P2G1+G2P3+G3**
Thus,
**Ci** **=** **F(P,G,C0)**

us illustrate taking a 4-bit adder as an example. This expression can be used to construct a carry look-ahead adder of any number of bits.
A 4bitCarryLookAhead (CLA)addercan be constructed with the help of following steps (Assuming T as the

3. GenerateSumsignalsS=PxorC.Itwillbevalidafter4Ttime.
Thus,Sumsignalswillbevalidafteradelayof4T. On the other hand, delay expression in
case of ripple carry adder = (2n+2)T. Thus, for n =4, i.e. for 4 bit ripple
carry adder, delay will be 10T.
For higher order addition, boolean
expression of carry output becomes more complex. So, there is tradeoff between area and speed. For larger number of bits, increase in area is more than
speed advantage obtained. Hence, Carry Look Ahead adders are usually implemented as 4-bit
modules that are used to build larger size adders.
Below is a nice video that explains about carry look ahead adders (taken from youtube).

"carry propagation time is the major speed limiting factor"
Wrong. Thirty years ago that was true but that was when gate delays dominated over routing delays. With today's processes your speed is now dominated by routing.
This means that if you lay out a ripple carry adder and minimize the total length of the carry chain to pack it into a nice tight array then you will achieve your fastest possible design. Any attempt to route the carry through outside logic will cost more in extra routing delay than you will pick up by bypassing chunks of your carry chain.
That is why timing estimates that don't factor in routing are useless in today's world

Yes. You are right. It is better to consider routing delays too. But it is also true that if you pack the carry look ahead adder too in compact shape, it is quite likely that it will have faster speed. Longer nets come into picture only in case the bit width of the adder becomes greater than 4 or 5. That is why, it is preferred to have a mix of carry look ahead adder modules arranged in form of ripple carry adders.
In other words, we can assume that in place of one-bit full adder, we have used 2-bit or 4-bit full adders to assemble ripple carry adders.
I agree with your last line
"timing estimates that don't factor in routing are useless in today's world"
:)

### 1. Interesting Design Quiz -  BCD multiply by five circuit

**Date:** 2012-12
**URL:** [https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2012/12/problem-make-digital-circuit-that-takes.html](https://vlsiuniverse.blogspot.com/2012/12/problem-make-digital-circuit-that-takes.html)

### Interesting Design Quiz - BCD multiply by five circuit
**Problem – Make a digital circuit that takes a BCD digit as input and produces the output that is equal to 5 times the digit in same format.**
> Solution – Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) is the format to
> represent decimal numbers in binary form. In this format, each digit of the
> decimal number is coded separately into 4-bit binary number. So, only binary
> values from 0000 to 1001 are valid codes. E.g. A two digit decimal number will
> be coded into BCD code with 8 binary digits.
> [![Binary multiplier for 5 times BCD multiplier](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5YZp9aNA3gQM3CB2yUyEIZ4y41Pmuuz6kuPaQbX9W6x94-iJjpim9Vi4kcEa5-loCVHS4oo_bsAIvluWrdjckWX61t8MXQ6uWpMC0XGyKdzURnvKvSedXQGdua9xM-jfEYpgK4f8x-wei/s320/X5.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5YZp9aNA3gQM3CB2yUyEIZ4y41Pmuuz6kuPaQbX9W6x94-iJjpim9Vi4kcEa5-loCVHS4oo_bsAIvluWrdjckWX61t8MXQ6uWpMC0XGyKdzURnvKvSedXQGdua9xM-jfEYpgK4f8x-wei/s1600/X5.png) Since, the circuit produces output that is 5 times the BCD
> digit, so, output value can contain maximum of 2 decimal digits OR 8 binary
> digits. Let I3-I0 be the 4-bit BCD digit input to the X5 multiplies and H3-H0
> and L3-L0 be the 8-bit BCD output as shown in the figure below.
The truth table for X5 multiplier can be represented as
shown in the figure below:
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| BCD<br>input | BCD<br>output | I3 | I2 | I1 | I0 | H3 | H2 | H1 | H0 | L3 | L2 | L1 | L0 |
| 0 | 00 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 05 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 2 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 15 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 4 | 20 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 25 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 6 | 30 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 7 | 35 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 8 | 40 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 9 | 45 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| X | XX | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| X | XX | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| X | XX | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| X | XX | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| X | XX | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| X | XX | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
Drawing K-maps for all the outputs:
**K Map for H3, L3 and L1**
|     |     |     |     |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
=\> H3
= L3= L1 = 0
Similarly, by solving using K-Maps for all the outputs, we get
H2 = I3
H1 = I2
H0 = I1
L2 = L0 = I0
Thus, all the outputs are either a direct connection from one of the inputs or zero. So, the whole function can be implemented without using a single logic gate. Sounds strange!!!
Can you come up with a better solution for this problem? Let us know with your comments.

We can implement using MUX and flip flop and adder . See multiple of 5 means adding number of 5's we can simply implement using MUX, adder,flip flop without using k map

Hi Meghna
Yes, you are right. There can be many solutions to a single problem. The solution that has been talked about in this post is with combinatorial design. The one you are talking about is sequential/FSM design. It will be interesting to see how the solution is figured out.

Implement with only adder:
Ax5 = Ax4+A = Ax2^2+A = (A<<2)+A

Hi Stas
Yes, a similar approach can be tried, the question is BCD multiply by 5. But yes, good approach. :-)
